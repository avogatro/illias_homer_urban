Here is the corrected HTML for **Book 20** of The Iliad. You can save this as `illiad-book20.html`.

I fixed the "Team USA" error to **"Team Greek"** as requested.

        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 20</p>

        <h2>The God Summit</h2>
        <p>Zeus looked down from Olympus. He saw Achilles in that new shiny armor.</p>
        <p>He called the gods. "Listen up," he said. "I know you all want to jump in. Today is the day."</p>
        <p>"Side with whoever you want. Help the Greeks or the Trojans. But if I see any god trying to play both sides, I'm throwing them into the dark pit."</p>
        <p>The gods rushed down. It was a full-on street fight now.</p>

        <h2>Team Greek vs Team Troy</h2>
        <p>The gods picked their squads.</p>
        <p>On the Trojan side: Ares, Apollo, Artemis, Leto, Xanthus (the river god).</p>
        <p>On the Greek side: Hera, Athena, Poseidon, Hermes, and Hephaestus.</p>
        <p>They stood on the hill overlooking the battlefield, shaking the earth just by standing there.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Achilles Enters the Chat</h2>
        <p>Achilles stepped out. His armor looked like fire.</p>
        <p>He wasn't just fighting anymore. He was looking for Hector specifically.</p>
        <p>Aeneas, a Trojan hero, saw him. He stepped up to the plate.</p>
        <p>"Let's see if you're all talk," Aeneas said.</p>
        <p>"Aeneas?" Achilles said. "You think you can take me? Last time you ran from me."</p>
        <p>Aeneas dropped some history on him. "My mom is Aphrodite. I'm not scared."</p>

        <h2>The Fight</h2>
        <p>They threw spears. They threw rocks. It was intense.</p>
        <p>Achilles was about to spear Aeneas in the throat. But Poseidon was watching. He loves Aeneas because he's a descendant of his own kid.</p>
        <p>Poseidon threw a magical mist. He swooped in, lifted Aeneas up, and threw him out of the danger zone.</p>
        <p>"You're dumb," Poseidon said to Aeneas. "Why fight a demigod? Go find some weaker soldiers."</p>
        <p>Aeneas landed back in his squad.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Rampage Begins</h2>
        <p>Achilles was furious his kill got stolen. He started killing everyone else.</p>
        <p>"You die. And you. You too."</p>
        <p>He saw Hector's brother, Polydorus, trying to run.</p>
        <p>Achilles threw a spear and stabbed him right in the back. Polydorus fell with his guts hanging out.</p>
        <p>Hector saw this. That was his little brother.</p>
        <p>Hector got hype. He rushed Achilles, even though Apollo was whispering, "Bro, don't do it."</p>

        <h2>The Chase</h2>
        <p>Hector threw his spear. It hit Achilles' shield perfectly, but the shield was Hephaestus-made. It didn't break.</p>
        <p>Achilles threw his back. It hit Hector's helmet but glanced off.</p>
        <p>Achilles cursed the gods for saving Hector.</p>
        <p>Hector turned to run. But Achilles was fast. He chased him.</p>
        <p>Most of the Trojans bailed. They ran into the river Xanthus to hide in the water.</p>
        <p>Achilles followed them into the river. He didn't care. He was going to kill them all.</p>
