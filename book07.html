        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 7</p>

        <h2>Hector Wants Smoke</h2>
        <p>Zeus was watching the fight. He was bored. He took his golden scales—the ones that measure fate—and tipped it.</p>
        <p>The scale landed on Hector. That meant Hector was the man of the hour.</p>
        <p>Hector shouted to the Greeks. "Listen up! I’m done killing randoms. I want a fair one. Bring out your best fighter. 1v1. Let's do it."</p>
        <p>The Greeks went quiet. Nobody wanted to step up. Hector was scary.</p>
        <p>Menelaus was about to go, but Agamemnon grabbed him. "Chill, bro. You love fighting, but Hector is a beast. You might get cooked."</p>

        <h2>Ajax Steps Up</h2>
        <p>Finally, big Ajax stepped forward. He stood there like a tank. He was the only one confident enough.</p>
        <p>"I'll do it," Ajax said. "I'm not scared of Hector."</p>
        <p>He put on his helmet. He looked like a walking mountain. The Greeks were hyped.</p>
        <p>Hector and Ajax walked to the middle of the no-man's-land. They circled each other like boxers.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The 12-Round Brawl</h2>
        <p>Hector threw his spear first. It hit Ajax’s shield but didn't go through. It bounced off.</p>
        <p>Ajax threw his. It went through Hector's shield and grazed his neck, drawing blood. But it didn't drop him.</p>
        <p>They were like, "Okay, spears are done."</p>
        <p>They picked up huge rocks. They were hurling boulders at each other like crazy people.</p>
        <p>Then they drew swords. They hacked at each other until sunset. It was a stalemate. Both guys were tired, sweating, but still standing.</p>

        <h2>Respect</h2>
        <p>The referees saw the sun going down. They blew the whistle.</p>
        <p>"Stop! Good game."</p>
        <p>Hector reached out his hand. "You're built different, Ajax. You're strong as a bull. Let's be cool."</p>
        <p>Ajax gave him a fist bump. "You too, man. You fight like a god. Best I've ever seen."</p>
        <p>They exchanged gifts. Hector gave Ajax his sword (with a silver handle). Ajax gave Hector his belt (and armor). No hard feelings.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Trojan Huddle</h2>
        <p>The next day, the Trojans met up. They were scared of Diomedes.</p>
        <p>Antenor stood up. "Yo, let's just give Helen back. And the loot. This war is draining us."</p>
        <p>Paris stood up. "Nah. I won't give her back. That’s weak. But I'll give back all the loot I stole. Plus extra."</p>
        <p>Priam, the King, was like, "Alright, I'll send a messenger. Let's tell the Greeks. We want peace."</p>

        <h2>The Greek Huddle</h2>
        <p>The messenger told the Greeks the deal. Agamemnon listened.</p>
        <p>Then Diomedes interrupted. "Stop! Don't listen to him."</p>
        <p>"Even if they give Helen back, don't trust 'em. Their hearts are crooked. Let's just fight until Troy falls."</p>
        <p>The army cheered. They wanted to keep fighting.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Truce & The Wall</h2>
        <p>They agreed to a one-day truce just to burn their dead bodies. Respect to the fallen.</p>
        <p>The Trojans did their thing. But the Greeks used the time smartly.</p>
        <p>Nestor said, "We need defenses. If they attack our ships, we’re cooked."</p>
        <p>They built a massive wall around their camp. Huge trenches. High gates. It was basically a fortress. Poseidon helped them build it fast.</p>
        <p>The Trojans saw the wall and got nervous. They called a meeting in the city. They planned how to attack the Greek wall.</p>
