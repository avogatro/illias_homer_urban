        <h2 id="book1">Book 1: The Beef Starts</h2>
        <h3>The Rage</h3>
        <p>Yo, listen up, Goddess. Sing about the rage of Achilles. Peleus’ son. The man was pressed. And that anger brought mad pain to the Greeks. It sent a lot of tough souls to Hades. Their bodies got left for the dogs and birds to eat. Zeus’ plan was fulfilled.</p>
        <p>Check it—it all started when Agamemnon and Achilles clashed. Which king of the gods sparked this drama?</p>

        <h3>The Plague</h3>
        <p>Apollo sent a nasty plague. The army was getting wrecked. First, he hit the mules and dogs. Then he hit the soldiers. Bodies were dropping everywhere. Pyres were burning non-stop.</p>

        <h3>Chryses Steps In</h3>
        <p>Chryses, a priest of Apollo, rolled up. He had a deal for the Greeks. "Agamemnon, Menelaus, y’all Greeks," he said. "The gods helped you trash Troy. Now, please accept this ransom. Take my daughter back."</p>
        <p>The whole army was like, "Yeah, respect the priest. Take the gold." But Agamemnon wasn't having it.</p>
        <p>"Nah," he said. "Get out of here before I catch a case." He told the old man to bounce and not come back.</p>

        


        <h3>Apollo Strikes Back</h3>
        <p>The old priest was scared but dipped. He prayed hard to Apollo. "Yo, Silver Bow God. You protect Chryse and holy Cilla. Hear me. Make the Greeks pay for my disrespect."</p>
        <p>Apollo heard him. He came down from Olympus mad as hell. He had his silver bow out. He moved like the night. He let arrows fly on the Greeks. The clang of his bow was terrifying. He shot for days. The funeral fires burned constantly.</p>

        <h3>Achilles Calls a Meeting</h3>
        <p>Achilles saw the chaos. He called a meeting. "Hera's man," he said, talking to Agamemnon. "We gotta fix this. Or we’re all gonna die from this plague."</p>
        <p>Calchas, the prophet, stood up. He knew the future. He spoke up. "Achilles, you got my back? Cause Agamemnon hates me. He's the boss, but he gets salty when I speak truth."</p>
        <p>Achilles checked him. "Say what you gotta say. I swear by Apollo, nobody will hurt you."</p>
        <p>So Calchas spilled the tea. "It ain't a sacrifice the gods want. It's Agamemnon dissing Chryses. He gotta give the daughter back. No ransom. And he gotta send a sacrifice to Chryse."</p>

        


        <h3>The Betrayal</h3>
        <p>Agamemnon stood up. He was heated. "Damn it, prophet! You always got bad news for me."</p>
        <p>He looked at the army. "I wanted the girl. I like her more than my wife. But okay, I'll give her back to save the army. But y’all gotta pay me back. I'm not taking the loss alone."</p>
        <p>Achilles stepped in. "You greedy piece of..." he shouted. "We all here fighting. You sitting back taking the best loot. If we take loot from the towns, I get nothing? That's cap. Nah, I'm done. I'm going home."</p>
        <p>Agamemnon didn't care. "Fine. Take your toys and go. I got other soldiers. But listen close—I'm coming for your prize, Briseis. I'm taking her just to prove I'm the boss."</p>

        <h3>The Standoff</h3>
        <p>Achilles was furious. He grabbed his sword handle. He was about to end Agamemnon right there.</p>
        <p>But Athena appeared invisible. She grabbed his hair. "Chill," she whispered. "Don't kill him, but you can roast him."</p>
        <p>Achilles listened. He dropped his sword but dropped bars too. "You drunk, dog-faced coward," Achilles yelled. "You wear armor like a boss, but you got no heart. I'm done helping you. Keep your girl. I swear by my scepter, one day you'll beg for my help, and I won't be there."</p>

        <h3>The Prayer</h3>
        <p>Achilles dipped. He sat by the black ships and cried. He called his mom, Thetis. She came out of the water. "Why are you crying, son?"</p>
        <p>"Agamemnon played me," Achilles said. "He stole my girl."</p>
        <p>Thetis was heated. "I'm going to talk to the big man, Zeus. He's gonna make the Trojans win until the Greeks respect you."</p>
        <p>She went to Olympus. She found Zeus sitting on the highest peak. She grabbed his knees and touched his chin. "Zeus, Daddy, help my boy. Make the Trojans push the Greeks back. Let Agamemnon know he messed up."</p>

        <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
        <p>Zeus stayed silent for a minute. "If I do this, Hera gonna beef. She hates Trojans." But he nodded. "Bet. It's done."</p>
        <p>Hera saw the nod. She stepped to Zeus. "Who you planning with now?" Zeus wasn't scared. "Mind your business. Go sit down." Hera got scared and shut up.</p>
        <p>The gods had a feast, getting turnt on nectar. Meanwhile, the Greeks went to bed, stressed out. And Agamemnon sent his boys to take Briseis from Achilles. Achilles let them go. He didn't fight back. He just walked to the ocean and prayed to his mom.</p>
        <p>"Mom, he actually took her." Thetis heard him from the deep. She went to Hephaestus to get new armor for her boy. Cause the war was about to get real.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book2">Book 2: The Fake News</h2>
        <h3>The Dream</h3>
        <p>That night, Zeus sent a dream to Agamemnon. It looked like Nestor, that old wise guy. The dream lied to him.</p>
        <p>"Yo, Agamemnon," the dream said. "You sleeping on the job? The gods are on your side now. You need to attack Troy today. You got this."</p>
        <p>Agamemnon woke up hype. He really thought he was gonna sack the city that day. He put on his gear and called the homies.</p>

        <h3>The Gaslight</h3>
        <p>Agamemmon stood up to speak. But he had a trick in mind. He wanted to test his soldiers.</p>
        <p>"Listen up," he lied. "Zeus is being shady. He told me we can't win. It's been nine years. We're stuck here. I'm tired. Let's pack up the boats and go home."</p>
        <p>He didn't really want to leave. He just wanted the boys to scream "No!" and get hyped to fight.</p>

        <h3>The Riot</h3>
        <p>But the plan backfired. As soon as he said "Go home," the army went crazy.</p>
        <p>They didn't scream "No!" They screamed "Bet!"</p>
        <p>Everyone ran to the ships. They were dragging them to the water. Dust was flying everywhere. It was chaos. They were deserting him.</p>

        <h3>Odysseus Steps In</h3>
        <p>Athena saw the mess. She came down and found Odysseus. "What are you doing?" she asked. "Are you gonna let them leave? Stop them!"</p>
        <p>Odysseus grabbed Agamemnon. "What is wrong with you?" he said. "Why you testing them? Now look at this mess."</p>
        <p>Odysseus ran to the ships. He wasn't asking nicely. He grabbed the scepter. If he saw a king, he said, "Chill, bro. You know better than Agamemnon."</p>
        <p>If he saw a regular soldier, he smacked him with the stick. "Get back in line, peasant!"</p>

        


        <h3>Thersites Gets Checked</h3>
        <p>Then there was Thersites. This guy was the ugliest troll in the army. Bow-legged, messed up hair, always running his mouth.</p>
        <p>He stood up and started roasting Agamemnon in front of everyone. "Look at this greedy clown," he yelled. "Always wanting the best loot. I'm going home!"</p>
        <p>The army started laughing. But Odysseus wasn't having it.</p>
        <p>He walked up to Thersites and backhanded him hard. Thersites started crying. A big welt popped up on his back.</p>
        <p>"Sit down and shut up," Odysseus said. "You think you can roast the king? You ain't nobody."</p>
        <p>The soldiers laughed at Thersites instead. Odysseus got the crowd back under control.</p>

        <h3>The Lineup (The Catalog)</h3>
        <p>Finally, the army calmed down. They got organized. Time for roll call. This list is long, so pay attention.</p>
        <p>Agamemnon brought the most ships (100). He's the boss.</p>
        <p>Ajax the Greater brought 12 ships. That guy is a tank.</p>
        <p>Idomeneus came from Crete with 80 ships.</p>
        <p>Odysseus came from Ithaca with Cephallenians. 12 ships. They are smart fighters.</p>
        <p>Achilles and the Myrmidons? Yeah, they chilling by the ships. Not joining the huddle.</p>
        <p>There were troops from Athens, Sparta, Pylos, Arcadia... seriously, everyone was there. Thousands of soldiers. It looked like a sea of bronze and spears.</p>

        


        <h3>The Trojans</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, across the field, the Trojans were gearing up too. They were stationed in front of the city walls.</p>
        <p>Hector was the main man. Everyone looked up to him.</p>
        <p>Aeneas was there too, with his crew.</p>
        <p>Priam’s sons: Helenus, Deiphobus, Paris (that pretty boy who started this mess).</p>
        <p>Sarpedon showed up with the Lycians. He was ready to throw hands.</p>
        <p>And the allies? Glaucus, Asteropaeus... a whole squad of tough guys from foreign lands.</p>

        <h3>The Showdown</h3>
        <p>The two armies stood on the plain. It was tense. Like two gangs facing off in the street.</p>
        <p>Alexander (Paris) stepped out from the Trojan line. He had leopard skin on his shoulders and a bow. He looked flashy.</p>
        <p>He wanted to go mano-a-mano with the Greeks. He wanted to fight Menelaus.</p>
        <p>Menelaus saw him. "There he is," he said. "The guy who played me."</p>
        <p>The Greeks cheered. The Trojans shivered. The battle was about to pop off.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book3">Book 3: The 1v1 Challenge</h2>
        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>The two armies marched toward each other like two giant waves about to crash. The dust was kicking up, and the noise was insane.</p>
        <p>Then, Paris stepped out from the Trojan line. He looked fresh. He had leopard skin on his shoulders, a shiny sword, and two bronze spears.</p>
        <p>He challenged the Greeks to a duel. "Yo, listen up!" he yelled. "Let's stop this big war. I want to fight Menelaus 1v1. Winner takes Helen and all the loot. If I win, y'all go home. If he wins, I take the L and you guys can keep her."</p>

        <h3>The Reaction</h3>
        <p>Menelaus heard this and got super hyped. "Finally! This is what I wanted. Let's end this now."</p>
        <p>The Greek army was silent for a second, then went crazy. They wanted this beef over with. Nobody wanted to die because Paris was acting thirsty.</p>
        <p>Hector, Paris's brother, wasn't happy though. He knew Paris was soft. "Bro, you look tough now, but you ain't about that life," he whispered. "You want to fight a man who ate you alive last time?"</p>
        <p>Paris flexed back. "Chill, Hector. Don't hate the player. Just get the priests so we can do the oath."</p>

        


        <h3>Helen on the Balcony</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, old King Priam was sitting on the wall of Troy with the elders. He saw Helen walking up and called her over.</p>
        <p>"Come here, sweetheart. Point out the Greek soldiers for me. Who's that big tank down there?"</p>
        <p>Helen looked sad. She felt guilty. "Respectfully, Dad," she said. "I wish I died before I ran off with Paris. But fine, I'll tell you."</p>
        <p>"That's Agamemnon," she said. "The boss. He's wide and powerful."</p>
        <p>"That's Odysseus. He looks small, but he's the smartest guy out there. A master strategist."</p>
        <p>"And that giant wall of muscle? That's Ajax. He holds the line like a human shield."</p>
        <p>Priam looked at them and nodded. "You are beautiful, child. But the gods really cursed us with this mess."</p>

        <h3>The Oath</h3>
        <p>Back on the battlefield, Hector went to the middle of the field. He stopped the armies from fighting. "Hold up!" he yelled.</p>
        <p>Agamemnon told his squad to drop their weapons. Hector did the same.</p>
        <p>Agamemnon and Hector met in the middle to make the deal official. They brought out a ram and a lamb to sacrifice to Zeus.</p>
        <p>The deal was this: If Paris wins, the Greeks leave. If Menelaus wins, the Trojans give Helen back and pay for the stolen goods. If anyone breaks the truce, Zeus destroys them.</p>
        <p>Everyone poured wine on the ground. "If anyone breaks this oath, may their brains melt like this wine," they swore.</p>

        


        <h3>The Fight</h3>
        <p>They put the names in a helmet and shook them. Paris's name popped out. He had to throw the first spear.</p>
        <p>He geared up. He threw that spear hard. It hit Menelaus’s shield—CLANG—but just bounced off. The shield was too strong.</p>
        <p>Menelaus didn't flinch. He grabbed his own spear. "My turn."</p>
        <p>He threw it like a sniper. It went right through Paris's shield and tore his armor. It scratched him, but Paris dipped out of the way just in time. It didn't kill him.</p>
        <p>Menelaus drew his sword. He rushed Paris and swung for the fences. But the sword shattered on the helmet! The metal broke into pieces.</p>
        <p>"Damn it!" Menelaus yelled. He was weaponless. But he didn't quit. He grabbed Paris by the helmet strap and started dragging him back to the Greek lines.</p>
        <p>Paris was tripping. The strap was choking him. He was done for. Menelaus was pulling him like a ragdoll.</p>

        <h3>The Cheat Code</h3>
        <p>Just as Menelaus was about to finish him, Aphrodite—the goddess who is obsessed with Paris—saw he was losing.</p>
        <p>She was like, "Oh no, my boy is getting cooked."</p>
        <p>She used her god powers. She snapped the strap of the helmet. Menelaus was left holding an empty helmet. He spun around confused. "Where he go?!"</p>
        <p>Aphrodite grabbed Paris, wrapped him in a cloud of mist, and teleported him to his bedroom. Safe and sound. Like a total glitch in the game.</p>

        <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
        <p>Menelaus was furious. He was looking everywhere. "He just vanished! That's impossible."</p>
        <p>Aphrodite went to get Helen. "Come to the bedroom," she said. "Paris wants you. He's looking cute and sad."</p>
        <p>Helen wasn't buying it. "Don't play with me," she said. "I'm not going to sleep with that loser. I'm done."</p>
        <p>But Aphrodite threatened her. So Helen went.</p>
        <p>Back on the field, Agamemnon was hyping his side. "Menelaus won! The Trojans gotta pay up!"</p>
        <p>The Greeks were ready to fight again.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book4">Book 4: The Cheap Shot</h2>
        <h3>The God Meeting</h3>
        <p>Up on Olympus, the gods were chilling. Zeus looked down at the battlefield.</p>
        <p>"Yo, this truce is beautiful," he said. "Maybe we should just end the war now. Let Menelaus keep his win."</p>
        <p>Hera, who absolutely hates the Trojans, was not having it. She rolled her eyes.</p>
        <p>"Are you serious?" she snapped. "You just gonna let them off the hook? All my effort wasted?"</p>
        <p>Zeus knew better than to argue. "Fine, fine. You win. Do what you want. But expect me to be mad."</p>

        <h3>Athena's Scheme</h3>
        <p>Hera gathered the troops. She told Athena, "Go down there. Make sure the Trojans break the truce first. We need a reason to crash out on them."</p>
        <p>Athena was down. She transformed herself to look like a Trojan soldier. She found a guy named Pandarus.</p>
        <p>This Pandarus was a sniper. He had a crazy bow. Athena whispered in his ear.</p>
        <p>"Hey, pretty boy," she lied. "Look at Menelaus standing there like a boss. If you snipe him right now, you’d be famous. You’d get so much clout."</p>
        <p>Pandarus was dumb enough to listen.</p>

        


        <h3>The Cheap Shot</h3>
        <p>Pandarus pulled out his bow. It was made from antelope horns—top-tier gear. He prayed to Apollo.</p>
        <p>He took aim. He released the string. The arrow flew fast and silent.</p>
        <p>*Thwack.*</p>
        <p>It hit Menelaus. It didn't kill him, thank the gods. It went through his gear and grazed his skin, drawing blood. But it looked way worse than it was.</p>

        <h3>Agamemnon Freaks Out</h3>
        <p>When Agamemnon saw his brother hit, he panicked.</p>
        <p>"Oh my god! He's dead! The truce is broken! This is exactly why you can't trust Trojans!"</p>
        <p>He was ready to burn the whole place down. "We’re going to lose this war without him!"</p>

        <h3>The Doctor</h3>
        <p>But the medic, Machaon, stepped up. "Hold up," he said. "Let me check him."</p>
        <p>He examined the wound. He pulled out the arrow. He sucked out the blood and applied some special ointment.</p>
        <p>"He's good," Machaon said. "It's just a scratch. The armor saved him."</p>
        <p>Menelaus got back up, ready to fight. The army was hyped again.</p>

        


        <h3>The Hype Speech</h3>
        <p>Agamemnon took the mic. He started roasting his own troops to get them motivated.</p>
        <p>"Look at you cowards," he yelled. "You act tough, but you just wanna run away. If you leave now, you go home broke."</p>
        <p>Then he praised the kings. He went to Odysseus. "You keep it real, son. You don't talk much, but when you fight, you fight."</p>
        <p>He went to Agamemnon (himself) and Ajax. "These guys are beasts."</p>
        <p>He even roasted Idomeneus a little. Just to keep everyone on their toes.</p>

        <h3>The Clash</h3>
        <p>The horns blew. *TOOOOT. TOOOOT.*</p>
        <p>The Greeks marched forward like a tidal wave. The Trojans screamed back and charged.</p>
        <p>They collided in the middle of the plain. Shields crashed against spears. It was a brawl.</p>
        <p>Blood started flowing immediately. It was chaos. No more truce. It was straight murder.</p>
        <p>Simoisius, a young Trojan, got killed by Ajax. He didn't even know what hit him.</p>
        <p>Antilochus, a Greek, killed a Trojan guy named Echepolus with a rock to the head. Straight up dropped him.</p>
        <p>The bodies started piling up. Dust covered everyone. The war was back on.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book5">Book 5: Diomedes Goes Beast Mode</h2>
        <h3>Diomedes Goes Beast Mode</h3>
        <p>Meet Diomedes. He’s a Greek king, and today is his day. He’s in the zone. He’s possessed by the spirit of war.</p>
        <p>Athena is literally standing behind his chariot, hyping him up. She took the "fog" off his eyes so he can spot the gods on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Diomedes starts wrecking shop. He’s killing Trojan soldiers left and right. It looks like a horror movie. Bodies dropping everywhere.</p>

        <h3>Aeneas vs. Diomedes</h3>
        <p>Pandarus—that guy who shot the arrow in the last book—steps up. He says to Aeneas, "Yo, let's get Diomedes."</p>
        <p>Pandarus throws a spear. Hits Diomedes' shoulder. But Diomedes is built different. He barely flinches.</p>
        <p>Diomedes throws his spear back. *Kaboom.* It goes right through Pandarus' face. Game over for him.</p>
        <p>Now it's Diomedes vs. Aeneas. Aeneas grabs a rock—he’s about to crush Diomedes. But Aeneas is a demigod son of Aphrodite, so he has backup.</p>

        


        <h3>Aphrodite Gets Cut</h3>
        <p>Aphrodite sees her son Aeneas is in trouble. She throws a cloud over him to hide him and grabs him to pull him out.</p>
        <p>Diomedes sees the goddess. He doesn't care. "Get off the field, goddess!" he yells.</p>
        <p>He lunges with his spear and cuts her wrist.</p>
        <p>She screams. *Ichor*—that’s god blood—spills out. It looks gold. It hurts like crazy because gods are usually immortal.</p>
        <p>Aphrodite drops Aeneas and runs away crying to Olympus. "Dad, did you see that? Diomedes just tried to scrap me!"</p>

        <h3>Apollo Intervenes</h3>
        <p>Apollo, Aeneas' other dad (long story), catches his son before he hits the ground.</p>
        <p>He creates a fake body of Aeneas so the Greeks can fight over that while he teleports the real Aeneas back to his shrine to heal.</p>
        <p>Diomedes, still hyped on rage, screams at Apollo. "I’m coming for you too!"</p>
        <p>Apollo looks at him. "Nah, son. Don't be dumb. I'm an eternal god. Don't step to me."</p>
        <p>Diomedes backs down. He knows his limits.</p>

        


        <h3>The Rivalry</h3>
        <p>Ares, the God of War, is on the Trojan side. He sees how hard Diomedes is killing his team. He decides to get involved disguised as a mortal.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Athena finds Diomedes again. "I see you winning," she says. "I’m giving you a permanent buff. If Ares comes near, hit him. He’s a punk."</p>

        <h3>Diomedes vs. Ares</h3>
        <p>Ares and Diomedes meet. Ares throws a spear, Athena swats it away. Then Diomedes throws his spear. Athena guides it.</p>
        <p>*THUNK.*</p>
        <p>The spear hits Ares right in the gut. It goes deep. Ares lets out a scream that sounds like 10,000 soldiers yelling at once.</p>
        <p>Ares drops his spear. He looks like he got jumped in an alley. He blasts off back to Olympus, terrified.</p>

        <h3>The Roast Session on Olympus</h3>
        <p>Ares stumbles in, bleeding god-blood. He sits next to Zeus and cries.</p>
        <p>"Dad, look at this wound! Athena set me up!"</p>
        <p>Zeus gives him the dirtiest look. "You're pathetic," Zeus says. "You love fighting, but you can't handle getting hit. You're the most annoying god I have."</p>
        <p>Zeus tells the healers to patch Ares up. Hera and Athena are lowkey laughing.</p>

        <h3>The End of the Day</h3>
        <p>Back on Earth, Diomedes is a legend. The Trojans are terrified of him. They think he’s invincible.</p>
        <p>The Trojans retreat back to their city walls. The Greeks are winning big time.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book6">Book 6: The Family Drama</h2>
        <h3>Cold-Blooded</h3>
        <p>The battle kept raging. The gods were just chilling, watching humans destroy each other.</p>
        <p>Diomedes was still in the zone. He took a Trojan named Adrestus alive. The guy was begging for his life.</p>
        <p>"Please," he cried. "My dad is rich! He'll pay you huge ransom!"</p>
        <p>Diomedes was about to listen, but Agamemnon cut in.</p>
        <p>"No, son," Agamemnon said. "Don't get soft. If you let them go, they just come back to fight us. Leave no survivors."</p>
        <p>So Diomedes did the dirty work. He killed the guy. Brutal.</p>

        <h3>The Trojan Plan</h3>
        <p>The Greeks were pushing hard. The Trojans were folding.</p>
        <p>Helenus, a Trojan prophet, saw what was happening. He pulled Hector aside.</p>
        <p>"Hector, listen. We losing bad. You need to go back to the city," he said.</p>
        <p>"Tell our mom to gather the ladies. Tell them to go to Athena’s temple and offer her a fancy dress. Pray for mercy. Maybe she’ll chill out on us."</p>

        


        <h3>Back in Troy</h3>
        <p>Hector bounced from the fight. The Greeks tried to shoot arrows at him, but his armor was too thick.</p>
        <p>He got to the city gates and met his mom, Hecuba.</p>
        <p>"Ma, don't give me wine," Hector said. "I'm weak. I need to be sober. Go tell the ladies to sacrifice to Athena. Give her the best dress in your closet."</p>
        <p>Hecuba did exactly that. She told the Trojan women to bring an offering.</p>
        <p>They prayed hard. But Athena left them on read. She wasn't interested.</p>

        <h3>The Paris Roast</h3>
        <p>Hector went to find his brother Paris. He found him at home, polishing his armor like a model.</p>
        <p>Hector was heated. "So you here playing dress-up while our boys die out there?" he yelled.</p>
        <p>"The war is your fault, bro. You stole the girl, now you can't even fight for her?"</p>
        <p>Paris looked guilty. "My bad, Hector," he said. "I wasn't trying to slack. I was waiting for my squad. I'll go fight now."</p>
        <p>Hector calmed down. "Good. Come on. We gonna need you."</p>

        


        <h3>The Goodbye</h3>
        <p>Before going back to war, Hector stopped to see his wife, Andromache.</p>
        <p>She wasn't at home. She ran to the city wall to look for him.</p>
        <p>When she saw him, she burst into tears.</p>
        <p>"You're too brave, Hector," she said. "You're gonna get yourself killed. Then the Greeks will take our son, Astyanax, and throw him off the walls. Or make him a slave. I'll be a widow. It’s too much."</p>

        <h3>The Baby</h3>
        <p>Hector took off his helmet. His wife was scared of it. He held his son.</p>
        <p>But the baby started crying. The helmet was scary, and the plume on top made him nervous.</p>
        <p>Hector laughed. He took the helmet off and set it on the ground. He kissed his baby.</p>
        <p>Then he prayed. "Zeus, let this boy be a better man than me. Let him be strong. Let him bring joy to his mom."</p>

        <h3>The Motivation</h3>
        <p>Hector looked at his wife. "I know, babe. I worry too. But I can't just chill inside."</p>
        <p>"If I act like a coward, what will people say? If I don't fight, I'm dishonoring myself and my ancestors."</p>
        <p>"My heart hurts thinking about you getting dragged away by Greeks. But I have to do this."</p>
        <p>He reached for his baby, but the kid clung to his mom’s dress. Hector smiled, touched his son's hair, and put his helmet back on.</p>
        <p>He walked away. Andromache watched him go, crying like she was already at his funeral.</p>
        <p>Hector went back to the gates. The war was waiting.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book7">Book 7: The 12-Round Brawl</h2>
        <h3>Hector Wants Smoke</h3>
        <p>Zeus was watching the fight. He was bored. He took his golden scales—the ones that measure fate—and tipped it.</p>
        <p>The scale landed on Hector. That meant Hector was the man of the hour.</p>
        <p>Hector shouted to the Greeks. "Listen up! I’m done killing randoms. I want a fair one. Bring out your best fighter. 1v1. Let's do it."</p>
        <p>The Greeks went quiet. Nobody wanted to step up. Hector was scary.</p>
        <p>Menelaus was about to go, but Agamemnon grabbed him. "Chill, bro. You love fighting, but Hector is a beast. You might get cooked."</p>

        <h3>Ajax Steps Up</h3>
        <p>Finally, big Ajax stepped forward. He stood there like a tank. He was the only one confident enough.</p>
        <p>"I'll do it," Ajax said. "I'm not scared of Hector."</p>
        <p>He put on his helmet. He looked like a walking mountain. The Greeks were hyped.</p>
        <p>Hector and Ajax walked to the middle of the no-man's-land. They circled each other like boxers.</p>

        


        <h3>The 12-Round Brawl</h3>
        <p>Hector threw his spear first. It hit Ajax’s shield but didn't go through. It bounced off.</p>
        <p>Ajax threw his. It went through Hector's shield and grazed his neck, drawing blood. But it didn't drop him.</p>
        <p>They were like, "Okay, spears are done."</p>
        <p>They picked up huge rocks. They were hurling boulders at each other like crazy people.</p>
        <p>Then they drew swords. They hacked at each other until sunset. It was a stalemate. Both guys were tired, sweating, but still standing.</p>

        <h3>Respect</h3>
        <p>The referees saw the sun going down. They blew the whistle.</p>
        <p>"Stop! Good game."</p>
        <p>Hector reached out his hand. "You're built different, Ajax. You're strong as a bull. Let's be cool."</p>
        <p>Ajax gave him a fist bump. "You too, man. You fight like a god. Best I've ever seen."</p>
        <p>They exchanged gifts. Hector gave Ajax his sword (with a silver handle). Ajax gave Hector his belt (and armor). No hard feelings.</p>

        


        <h3>The Trojan Huddle</h3>
        <p>The next day, the Trojans met up. They were scared of Diomedes.</p>
        <p>Antenor stood up. "Yo, let's just give Helen back. And the loot. This war is draining us."</p>
        <p>Paris stood up. "Nah. I won't give her back. That’s weak. But I'll give back all the loot I stole. Plus extra."</p>
        <p>Priam, the King, was like, "Alright, I'll send a messenger. Let's tell the Greeks. We want peace."</p>

        <h3>The Greek Huddle</h3>
        <p>The messenger told the Greeks the deal. Agamemnon listened.</p>
        <p>Then Diomedes interrupted. "Stop! Don't listen to him."</p>
        <p>"Even if they give Helen back, don't trust 'em. Their hearts are crooked. Let's just fight until Troy falls."</p>
        <p>The army cheered. They wanted to keep fighting.</p>

        <h3>The Truce & The Wall</h3>
        <p>They agreed to a one-day truce just to burn their dead bodies. Respect to the fallen.</p>
        <p>The Trojans did their thing. But the Greeks used the time smartly.</p>
        <p>Nestor said, "We need defenses. If they attack our ships, we’re cooked."</p>
        <p>They built a massive wall around their camp. Huge trenches. High gates. It was basically a fortress. Poseidon helped them build it fast.</p>
        <p>The Trojans saw the wall and got nervous. They called a meeting in the city. They planned how to attack the Greek wall.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book8">Book 8: Zeus Takes Over</h2>
        <h3>Zeus Makes The Rules</h3>
        <p>Zeus woke up and slammed his fist. "Listen up, everyone. Today, I call the shots. No god is allowed to help the Greeks or Trojans."</p>
        <p>"If you even try, I'm throwing you into the deep abyss. No cap."</p>
        <p>He grabbed his thunderbolts and jumped in his chariot. He rode to the highest peak of Mount Ida to watch the show.</p>
        <p>The other gods were forced to sit and watch. They couldn't touch the field.</p>

        <h3>The Trojan Push</h3>
        <p>The battle started. Zeus turned his scales toward the Trojans. The heavy side meant they were winning today.</p>
        <p>Thunder crashed. The Trojans got hype. They attacked like a pack of wolves.</p>
        <p>Hector led the charge. "Today is the day we take their ships!" he yelled.</p>

        


        <h3>Nestor's Save</h3>
        <p>The Greeks were getting folded. Teucer, a Greek archer, was sniping Trojans. He killed like 8 guys. But Hector threw a rock and shattered his collarbone.</p>
        <p>Diomedes and Odysseus tried to hold the line. But Zeus threw lightning at them. They felt the fear. They realized the gods were against them today.</p>
        <p>Old Nestor saw Diomedes retreating. "What are you doing?" he yelled.</p>
        <p>Diomedes was salty. "It's Zeus, man. He’s blocking us. But I won't run."</p>
        <p>Nestor grabbed him. "Bro, Hector is possessed by Ares today. You gotta pull back. If we lose you, we lose the war."</p>

        <h3>Agamemnon Panics</h3>
        <p>Agamemnon saw the Greeks running. He started spiraling.</p>
        <p>"It’s over!" he cried. "Zeus hates me. Let's pack the boats. We gotta go home."</p>
        <p>Zeus didn't like that. He sent an eagle with a live snake in its claws.</p>
        <p>The snake bit the eagle, and the eagle dropped it on the altar. The Trojans saw it and were shook. Nestor saw it too.</p>
        <p>"Don't run!" Nestor told Agamemnon. "That's a sign. Even if Zeus wants to play us, we stay and fight. We hold the wall."</p>

        


        <h3>Behind the Wall</h3>
        <p>The Greeks barely made it back to their camp. They huddled behind the new wall they built.</p>
        <p>The Trojans stopped just outside. They didn't go home. They posted up right there in the field.</p>
        <p>Hector ordered his squad to set up camp. "No one goes home yet! We build fires and eat. If the Greeks try to use the ships to leave, we attack."</p>
        <p>The Trojans made thousands of campfires. It looked like stars in the sky, but it was just an army waiting to kill.</p>
        <p>Inside the Greek wall, everyone was stressed out. Agamemnon was pacing around. Everyone was blaming him.</p>
        <p>"It's your fault," they said. "You insulted Achilles. Now we're all gonna die."</p>
        <p>Agamemnon was broken. He agreed to send gifts to Achilles and apologize. But the damage was done.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book9">Book 9: The Embassy</h2>
        <h3>The Panic Attack</h3>
        <p>Agamemnon was shook. The Greeks were hiding in their ships, terrified of Hector.</p>
        <p>He called a meeting. "I'm done," he said. "Zeus is clearly hating on me. Let's pack up and leave."</p>
        <p>Diomedes wasn't having it. "You can run if you want, but I'm staying. The others will agree with me."</p>
        <p>Nestor stepped up. "Don't be a coward. But listen, we messed up with Achilles. We need to fix it."</p>

        <h3>The Peace Offering</h3>
        <p>Agamemnon realized he was wrong. He decided to send a "goody bag" to Achilles to apologize.</p>
        <p>"I'll give him huge gifts," Agamemnon said. "7 cities, gold, and Briseis back. I swear, I didn't touch her. She's still fresh."</p>
        <p>He picked a top-tier squad to deliver the message. The smooth talkers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Odysseus (The smart one)</li>
            <li>Phoenix (Achilles' old mentor)</li>
            <li>Ajax (The tank)</li>
        </ul>

        


        <h3>The Tent Visit</h3>
        <p>The crew walked along the beach. They found Achilles chilling, playing his lyre like he didn't have a care in the world.</p>
        <p>Patroclus, his best friend, was there. He served the boys some food and drinks.</p>
        <p>Odysseus stood up first. He started his speech.</p>

        <h3>The Pitch</h3>
        <p>"Yo, Achilles. The situation is bad. The Trojans are pushing up on our ships. Hector is scary out there."</p>
        <p>"Agamemnon knows he messed up. He's sorry. Look at what he’s offering: Infinite gold, horses, and 7 of the finest women."</p>
        <p>"Plus, he's giving you one of his daughters. If you come back now, you get a massive dowry. You'd be rich."</p>

        <h3>The Hard No</h3>
        <p>Achilles rolled his eyes. "Odysseus, stop with the cap. I don't care about money."</p>
        <p>"We all have the same destiny. We all die eventually. Cowards die, heroes die. It doesn't matter."</p>
        <p>"Agamemnon took my girl. Nothing he gives me now fixes that disrespect. I'm going home. I want a wife, not war."</p>

        


        <h3>The Dad Talk</h3>
        <p>Phoenix started crying. He was the one who raised Achilles when he was a kid.</p>
        <p>"Son, don't be like that. Look at the story of Meleager. He got mad at his family and sat out a war. By the time he cooled down, his people had already paid him off with less loot."</p>
        <p>"Don't wait until the city is on fire to fight. Take the gifts now."</p>
        <p>Achilles was still stubborn. "I like you, Phoenix. You raised me. But I still say no. The anger tastes too good right now."</p>

        <h3>The Honest Truth</h3>
        <p>Ajax the Great stood up. He didn't use fancy words. He kept it 100.</p>
        <p>"He’s stubborn," Ajax said. "You can offer him the world, he won't take it. He’s holding a grudge too hard."</p>
        <p>"Let's just go back and tell the truth. The Greeks are on their own."</p>

        <h3>The Failure</h3>
        <p>They walked back. The whole Greek army was waiting.</p>
        <p>"So?" they asked. "Is he coming?"</p>
        <p>Odysseus shook his head. "Nope. He's too salty."</p>
        <p>The army went silent. Everyone was terrified. They spent the night praying and watching Hector light bonfires by their wall.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book10">Book 10: The Night Raid</h2>
        <h3>Bad Vibes Only</h3>
        <p>The Greeks were stressed. Agamemnon couldn't sleep. He was pacing the tent, sweating bullets.</p>
        <p>He put on his gear and went to check on the guards. He found Nestor.</p>
        <p>"Nestor," he whispered. "I'm freaking out. We're losing. We need a plan."</p>
        <p>Nestor agreed. "Let's send scouts. See what the Trojans are plotting at night."</p>

        <h3>The Dynamic Duo</h3>
        <p>"Who's down for a sneak mission?" Nestor asked.</p>
        <p>Diomedes stood up. "I got this. I'm not scared of the dark."</p>
        <p>"Pick a homie to go with you," Nestor said.</p>
        <p>Diomedes chose Odysseus immediately. "He's smart. He's got the best ideas."</p>
        <p>They walked out of camp. They were basically in stealth mode. They were like shadows.</p>

        


        <h3>The Snitch</h3>
        <p>Hector was also on his grind. He asked for a volunteer to spy on the Greeks.</p>
        <p>A guy named Dolon raised his hand. "I'll go. But I want Achilles' chariot and his horses as a payment."</p>
        <p>Hector agreed. Dolon put on a weasel-skin cap and started creeping toward the Greek ships.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Diomedes and Odysseus saw him coming.</p>
        <p>"Yo, someone is coming," Odysseus whispered. "Let's hide and jump him."</p>
        <p>They waited. Dolon walked right past them.</p>
        <p>Diomedes lunged. *Gotcha.* He pinned him to the ground.</p>

        <h3>The Interrogation</h3>
        <p>Dolon was crying. "Don't kill me! I'm rich! I'm Hector's messenger!"</p>
        <p>Odysseus grabbed him. "Listen. Don't lie. Are you spying? Where's Hector sleeping? Who are the Trojans camped with?"</p>
        <p>Dolon spilled everything. He was singing like a bird.</p>
        <p>"Hector is near the ships. But the Thracians are the ones you want. They just showed up. Their King, Rhesus, has the craziest white horses. They are faster than the wind. Golden armor too."</p>

        


        <h3>The Takeout</h3>
        <p>Odysseus looked at Diomedes. "You heard the man. Let's go get those horses."</p>
        <p>But first—*Chop.* Diomedes killed Dolon. Cold-blooded.</p>
        <p>They crept over to the Thracian camp. Everyone was asleep, passed out after drinking.</p>
        <p>It was a massacre. Diomedes moved through the tents like a ghost. He killed 12 Thracians in their sleep.</p>

        <h3>The Getaway</h3>
        <p>Diomedes got to King Rhesus. He sliced the King's throat while he dreamed.</p>
        <p>Odysseus grabbed the white horses. He had to untie them.</p>
        <p>Athena helped them out. She told them to bounce.</p>
        <p>They rode the horses back to the Greek ships. It looked sick.</p>

        <h3>Safe & Sound</h3>
        <p>They got back to base and washed the blood off in the ocean.</p>
        <p>They sat in Agamemnon's tent. "Look what we got," Diomedes said.</p>
        <p>They sacrificed a horse to Athena. Everyone ate some food.</p>
        <p>While the Greeks celebrated the loot, the Trojans were waking up to a nightmare. The King was dead. The horses were gone. Panic spread.</p>
        <p>It was a W for the Greeks.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book11">Book 11: Agamemnon's Moment</h2>
        <h3>Agamemnon's Moment</h3>
        <p>Eos (the Dawn) showed up. Zeus woke up and sent Iris to deliver a message.</p>
        <p>"Hey Agamemnon," Iris whispered. "Get dressed. Zeus wants you to hype your boys up. You're gonna win big today."</p>
        <p>Agamemnon put on his gear. He looked fresh. Massive armor, huge shield, sword like a chopping block.</p>
        <p>The soldiers were hyped. They marched out like a swarm of bees.</p>

        <h3>The Rampage</h3>
        <p>Agamemnon was on one today. He was killing everything that moved.</p>
        <p>Trojan soldiers were scattering. He was chopping them down like a man cutting grass. It was ugly.</p>
        <p>He killed two of Priam’s sons. He killed their charioteers. Blood and dust everywhere.</p>
        <p>The Trojans were folding. They were running back to the city gates.</p>

        


        <h3>The L</h3>
        <p>Just as Agamemnon was chasing them, a Trojan named Coon stepped up.</p>
        <p>His brother was just killed by Agamemnon. Coon was mad.</p>
        <p>He snuck up and speared Agamemnon right in the arm. It wasn't a fatal hit, but it hurt bad. He missed the elbow but went through the muscle.</p>
        <p>Agamemnon was shook. He told his charioteer, "Turn this car around. I need to patch this up."</p>
        <p>He dipped from the battlefield. When Hector saw the boss leave, he got hype. "The king is down! Let's push!"</p>

        <h3>Diomedes Out</h3>
        <p>Hector charged into the Greek lines. Diomedes tried to stop him.</p>
        <p>But remember Paris? The guy who started all this? He was hiding behind a rock with his bow.</p>
        <p>He shot Diomedes in the foot. Right in the toes.</p>
        <p>Diomedes cursed at him. "You pretty boy shooter! You aim at the feet because you're scared of the face?"</p>
        <p>He grabbed the arrow, pulled it out, and told his driver to bail. He hopped back to the ships.</p>

        


        <h3>Odysseus vs. The Squad</h3>
        <p>Odysseus was left alone. He looked at his squad. Everyone was retreating.</p>
        <p>"What am I, a turtle? I don't run!" he said.</p>
        <p>He stood his ground. He killed a Trojan leader. But then, he got surrounded.</p>
        <p>It was 5 on 1. Then 10 on 1.</p>
        <p>Socus, a Trojan, ran up and speared Odysseus in the ribs. *Shank.* It went deep. Odysseus got dizzy.</p>
        <p>But he threw his spear back and killed Socus. He was bleeding out. He yelled, "Yo, Ajax! Help me!"</p>

        <h3>The Save</h3>
        <p>Ajax the Great heard the scream. He came running like a tank.</p>
        <p>He charged into the crowd. Trojans scattered like bugs.</p>
        <p>Menelaus came too. They grabbed Odysseus and dragged him to safety.</p>
        <p>Odysseus was bleeding all over the chariot. Ajax kept holding the Trojans back while they got away.</p>

        <h3>The Doctor Down</h3>
        <p>Things were looking bad for the Greeks. The Trojans were wilding.</p>
        <p>Achilles (who was still chilling on his boat) saw Nestor driving a wounded soldier to the back.</p>
        <p>It was Machaon, the doctor. He took an arrow in the shoulder.</p>
        <p>Achilles turned to his best friend Patroclus. "Yo, go ask Nestor who that is. Why are they rushing the medic?"</p>
        <p>Patroclus ran off. Little did he know, asking that question was gonna change his life forever.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book12">Book 12: Hector's Cannonball</h2>
        <h3>The Sign</h3>
        <p>Zeus kept the Trojans hyped all night. He was throwing thunderbolts like fireworks.</p>
        <p>The next morning, the Trojans advanced on the Greek wall. They were confident.</p>
        <p>Polydamas, a smart Trojan captain, pulled Hector aside.</p>
        <p>"Yo, look at this bird sign," he said. "A hawk just snatched a dove but the dove fought back. I think it means if we cross the wall, we’re gonna get cooked. Let's stay back and attack with spears."</p>
        <p>Hector wasn't feeling it. "You talk too much," he said. "If you're scared, go home. We’re attacking. Zeus is on our side."</p>

        <h3>The Rush</h3>
        <p>Hector ordered the charge. But the Greek wall was strong. There was a huge ditch in front of it.</p>
        <p>Trojan chariots couldn't get across easily. They got stuck.</p>
        <p>So the Trojans had to go on foot. It was chaotic.</p>

        


        <h3>The Trap at the Gate</h3>
        <p>One Trojan captain, Asius, saw a gate that was left open. He tried to rush in.</p>
        <p>"Easy pickings!" he thought.</p>
        <p>Wrong move. It was a trap. Two Greek beasts, Leonteus and Polypoetes, were hiding there.</p>
        <p>They jumped him and his squad. It was a slaughter. Asius died fast. The Trojans realized, "Oh, this wall isn't a joke."</p>

        <h3>Hector's Cannonball</h3>
        <p>Hector was frustrated. He saw the Greeks holding the line.</p>
        <p>He shouted to the captains. "Bring me the biggest rocks you can find!"</p>
        <p>He picked up a stone that not even two normal men could lift. He chucked it right at the wooden double doors of the main gate.</p>
        <p>BOOM!</p>
        <p>The doors shattered. The hinges flew off. The stones crumbled. There was a hole in the defense.</p>

        


        <h3>Sarpedon's Speech</h3>
        <p>The Trojans stormed the breach. But the Greeks fought back.</p>
        <p>Sarpedon (the King of the Lycians) rallied his men. He gave a legendary speech.</p>
        <p>"Listen, bros. Why are we sitting in the back line getting respect? We need to earn it."</p>
        <p>"If we die today, at least we die as legends. Let's grab the wall!"</p>
        <p>He grabbed his shield and rushed the ramparts. He was fearless.</p>

        <h3>The Wall War</h3>
        <p>Sarpedon and Hector climbed the wall. The Greeks were terrified.</p>
        <p>Ajax the Great was there, trying to hold the line. He was knocking guys off the wall with stones.</p>
        <p>Ajax yelled at Teucer, the archer. "Where have you been? Shoot these guys!"</p>
        <p>But Zeus made Teucer's bowstring snap. He shot his brother by accident (lightly).</p>
        <p>It was total chaos. The Greeks were fighting for their lives, literally standing on the stones of their own wall.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book13">Book 13: Poseidon Sneaks In</h2>
        <h3>Poseidon Makes a Move</h3>
        <p>While Zeus was chillin' on the mountain, Poseidon was watching the Greeks get wrecked.</p>
        <p>He felt bad for them. He was like, "Nah, I can't let them die."</p>
        <p>He snuck out of the ocean. He was careful not to let Zeus see him. Zeus was distracted, looking the other way.</p>
        <p>Poseidon put on a disguise. He looked like a random human prophet.</p>

        <h3>The Pep Talk</h3>
        <p>Poseidon ran straight to the two Ajaxes (Big Ajax and Little Ajax).</p>
        <p>"Yo, listen," he whispered. "If you guys wanna survive, you gotta toughen up. Hector thinks he's winning. You gotta shut him down."</p>
        <p>He didn't just talk. He hit them with a magical energy boost. Suddenly, the Ajaxes felt unstoppable. They were ready to run through a wall.</p>
        <p>Poseidon kept running down the line, hyping everyone up. "Do it for your ships! Do it for your lives!"</p>

        


        <h3>Idomeneus the Savage</h3>
        <p>Then Poseidon found Idomeneus, a Cretan captain.</p>
        <p>"You're the man, Idomeneus. Where's your spear at?"</p>
        <p>Idomeneus was hyped. "I'm ready."</p>
        <p>He saw a Trojan friend named Meriones. "Yo, give me a spear. I left mine in the tent."</p>
        <p>Meriones gave him a good bronze one. "Here. Don't miss."</p>

        <h3>The Rampage</h3>
        <p>Idomeneus started killing everyone. He was in the zone.</p>
        <p>He dropped a Trojan named Othryoneus who just showed up trying to marry Cassandra.</p>
        <p>"Nice try, bro," Idomeneus said. "You said you'd kick the Greeks out. Look at you now. Dead."</p>
        <p>He killed like 5 guys in a row. He was showing off.</p>

        


        <h3>Deiphobus vs. Idomeneus</h3>
        <p>A Trojan prince named Deiphobus saw Idomeneus flexing.</p>
        <p>He challenged him. "You think you're hard? Watch this."</p>
        <p>He threw his spear. It hit Idomeneus' shield.</p>
        <p>Idomeneus threw his back. *SHANK.* It went right into Deiphobus' gut.</p>
        <p>Deiphobus was screaming in pain. His brother ran over to carry him away. It was a mess.</p>

        <h3>The Wall Holds</h3>
        <p>With Poseidon's magic buffing them, the Greeks pushed back hard.</p>
        <p>The Trojans stopped laughing. They were getting pushed away from the ships.</p>
        <p>Hector was still fighting, but his squad was crumbling. The wall was safe for now.</p>
        <p>Poseidon kept cheering from the sidelines. "Keep pushing! Don't let them win!"</p>

        


        <h2 id="book14">Book 14: Hera's Scheme</h2>
        <h3>Hera's Scheme</h3>
        <p>Hera saw Poseidon helping the Greeks. She wanted to help him mess with Zeus.</p>
        <p>She looked at Zeus and saw he was checking her out. She had a plan.</p>
        <p>"I'm gonna distract him with the booty," she thought.</p>
        <p>She went to Aphrodite, the goddess of love.</p>
        <p>"Hey, girl," Hera lied. "I need to go visit Ocean and Tethys. They are fighting. Let me borrow that magic bra. The one that makes you irresistible."</p>
        <p>Aphrodite was suspicious, but she didn't say no. "Here. Take it."</p>

        <h3>The Bribed Nap</h3>
        <p>Next, Hera found Hypnos, the god of Sleep.</p>
        <p>"Listen, I need you to knock Zeus out tonight. I'll pay you big time," she said.</p>
        <p>Hypnos was shaking. "No way. Last time I did that, he threw me into the ocean."</p>
        <p>"I'll give you Pasithea," Hera offered. "She's the prettiest of the Graces. You can marry her."</p>
        <p>Hypnos was down. "Bet. I’m in."</p>

        


        <h3>The Hookup</h3>
        <p>Hera put on the sexy gear. She smelled amazing. She walked up to Zeus on the mountain.</p>
        <p>Zeus took one look and lost it. "Dayum," he said. "You look better than ever."</p>
        <p>"Come on," Hera said, acting innocent. "Let's go find a spot."</p>
        <p>Zeus was simping hard. "If we go there, I don't think I can control myself."</p>
        <p>They went into a cave. They got busy. A gold cloud covered them.</p>

        <h3>The Knockout</h3>
        <p>As soon as Zeus was... relaxed, Hypnos hit him.</p>
        <p>*Pow.*</p>
        <p>Zeus was out cold. Heavy snoring.</p>
        <p>Hypnos ran to tell Poseidon. "The boss is asleep. Do your thing."</p>

        


        <h3>The Earthquake</h3>
        <p>Poseidon got hype. "Zeus is napping! I'm in charge now!"</p>
        <p>He ran to the front lines. He yelled, "Why are we losing? We are way stronger!"</p>
        <p>He got in the chariot and caused a massive earthquake.</p>
        <p>The ground shook. The Trojan horses panicked.</p>

        <h3>The Comeback</h3>
        <p>Ajax the Great saw his chance. "Boys, Zeus is asleep! Let's kill 'em!"</p>
        <p>The Greeks pushed forward. It was a massacre.</p>
        <p>Ajax speared a guy named Hippothous right through the chest.</p>
        <p>Hector tried to keep his squad together, but they were terrified of Poseidon.</p>
        <p>Even the smart Trojans were like, "We shouldn't have messed with these Greeks."</p>
        <p>The Greeks started winning. Thanks to a nap.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book15">Book 15: The Hangover</h2>
        <h3>The Hangover</h3>
        <p>Zeus woke up. He saw the Trojans were losing big time.</p>
        <p>He saw Hector on the ground, gasping for air. He saw Poseidon helping the Greeks.</p>
        <p>He looked at Hera. "I see you," he said. "You played me. You distracted me with the vibes."</p>
        <p>Hera tried to play innocent. "I didn't do anything!"</p>
        <p>Zeus wasn't having it. "You're lucky I don't end you right now. But we got rules. You gotta watch your mouth."</p>

        <h3>Getting the Squad in Line</h3>
        <p>Zeus ordered Hera to call the other gods.</p>
        <p>"Tell them if they help the Trojans or Greeks today, I'm throwing them into the deepest pit. No cap."</p>
        <p>Then he turned to Apollo. "You're too busy feeling sorry for Hector. Get back in the game."</p>
        <p>Then he called Poseidon. "Get out. Go home to the sea. Unless you want to fight me."</p>
        <p>Poseideon was salty. "Zeus, I'm your brother! You acting high and mighty."</p>
        <p>Zeus threatened him again. Poseideon sighed. "Fine. I dip." He walked away into the ocean.</p>

        


        <h3>Hector's 2.0 Update</h3>
        <p>Zeus turned back to Apollo. "Go heal Hector. Give him strength. Make the Greeks run again."</p>
        <p>Apollo flew down. He poured power into Hector.</p>
        <p>Hector got up like he was glitching. He felt fresh. He put his armor back on.</p>
        <p>The Trojans cheered when they saw their boss back on his feet.</p>
        <p>The Greeks saw it too and their stomachs dropped.</p>

        <h3>The Rush to the Sea</h3>
        <p>Teucer, a Greek archer, tried to snipe Hector. But Hector threw a rock and smashed his collarbone again.</p>
        <p>"Nobody can stop me!" Hector yelled.</p>
        <p>The Greeks broke formation. They ran screaming from the wall all the way to the beach.</p>
        <p>They were fighting literally by the water's edge now.</p>

        


        <h3>The Fire</h3>
        <p>Patroclus (Achilles' bestie) saw the smoke. The Trojans were setting their ships on fire.</p>
        <p>He ran back to Achilles. "Man, look," he said. "Our boys are getting cooked."</p>
        <p>Achilles was still salty. "So?"</p>
        <p>"If they burn the ships, we can't go home," Patroclus said. "Let me take your armor. Maybe if they see 'Achilles' coming out, they'll freeze."</p>
        <p>Achilles thought about it. "Alright. But don't get cocky. Just save the ships and come back."</p>
        <p>But it was too late. The Trojans were at the front door.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book16">Book 16: The Tragic Turn</h2>
        <h3>The Begging</h3>
        <p>Patroclus couldn't watch anymore. The Greeks were getting cooked right in front of their ships.</p>
        <p>He ran to Achilles, tears in his eyes. "Bro, look at them. They’re dying. If you won't fight, let me wear your armor. Maybe if the Trojans see *you*, they'll get scared."</p>
        <p>Achilles looked at him. He was torn. He still hated Agamemnon, but he loved Patroclus.</p>
        <p>"Fine," Achilles said. "Take my team. Take my gear. But listen close."</p>
        <p>"Push them back from the ships. That's it. Do NOT chase them all the way to the city. If you get cocky, you might catch a stray. I need you alive."</p>

        <h3>The Glitch</h3>
        <p>Patroclus suited up. He looked exactly like Achilles. He put the Myrmidons in the chariots.</p>
        <p>They stormed out of camp like a tidal wave.</p>
        <p>The Trojans saw him and froze. "Oh snap! It's Achilles! He's back!"</p>
        <p>The Trojans panicked. They thought the tank was back in the game. They started running immediately.</p>
        <p>Patroclus was eating them up. He killed like 5 guys in the first minute.</p>

        


        <h3>Sarpedon Dies</h3>
        <p>Zeus watched his son, Sarpedon, fighting Patroclus.</p>
        <p>Zeus wanted to save him. But Hera checked him. "If you save your son, all the other gods are gonna want to save their favorites. It'll break the game."</p>
        <p>Zeus sighed. He rained bloody tears on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Patroclus threw his spear. *THUNK.* Right through Sarpedon's heart. The Lycian king fell.</p>
        <p>His buddy Glaucus saw it and screamed. "Avenge the King!"</p>
        <p>There was a huge fight over the body. But the Greeks grabbed Sarpedon's gear and dragged him away. Zeus sent Apollo to clean the body and take it back to Troy for a proper funeral.</p>

        


        <h3>The Pride (Hubris)</h3>
        <p>Patroclus was winning too much. He forgot the rules.</p>
        <p>He killed the guy who stabbed Odysseus earlier. He killed Hector’s driver.</p>
        <p>He kept pushing and pushing. He went past the wall. He went past the trench. He was right at the gates of Troy.</p>
        <p>He was trying to storm the castle alone. Apollo saw this and was not impressed.</p>

        <h3>The Check</h3>
        <p>Apollo walked up behind Patroclus. "Sit down, son," he said.</p>
        <p>He slapped Patroclus' back so hard his helmet spun around. His shield fell off. He was stunned.</p>
        <p>A random Trojan named Euphorbus saw his chance. He threw a spear and stuck Patroclus in the back.</p>
        <p>Hector rode up on his chariot. He saw the great warrior down.</p>
        <p>Hector shouted, "You thought you could sack Troy? Watch this."</p>
        <p>He stabbed Patroclus right in the gut with a spear.</p>
        <p>Patroclus looked him in the eye. "You got me, but you didn't kill a random. I was wearing Achilles' armor. And Hector? You're next. You're days are numbered."</p>
        <p>Patroclus died.</p>
        <p>The war had just gotten personal.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book17">Book 17: The Heist</h2>
        <h3>The Heist</h3>
        <p>Menealus saw Patroclus go down. "We can't lose the body," he yelled.</p>
        <p>He stood over Patroclus like a guard dog. He killed anyone who tried to touch the gear.</p>
        <p>But Hector was right there. He yelled to his squad: "Whoever gets the body gets the loot! Let's go!"</p>
        <p>Hector stripped the armor off Patroclus. He was wearing Achilles' legendary gear now.</p>
        <p>Zeus watched Hector put on the helmet. "You look cool," Zeus thought, "but that armor is cursed. It's actually leading to your grave."</p>

        <h3>The Roast</h3>
        <p>Glaucus, the Lycian captain, was heated. He stepped to Hector.</p>
        <p>"Look at you, Hector. You claim you're the leader, but you act like a coward."</p>
        <p>"You let Sarpedon's body get dragged away by the Greeks without saying a word. But now you're fighting hard for this guy? Why? Because you want his shiny armor? You're clout chasing."</p>
        <p>Hector was angry but focused. "Don't test me. I fight for the win. Get your hands dirty."</p>

        


        <h3>The Mosh Pit</h3>
        <p>The fight turned into a straight-up scrum.</p>
        <p>Ajax the Great came up. "Who touches the body gets wrecked!"</p>
        <p>Athena also showed up in disguise to help the Greeks.</p>
        <p>Zeus was like, "If my son Sarpedon is gone, I don't care if his body gets dragged. I don't care if they strip him."</p>
        <p>But Zeus made sure Apollo saved Sarpedon's body and washed it clean earlier.</p>
        <p>Now, it was all about Patroclus.</p>

        <h3>The Tug-of-War</h3>
        <p>The Greeks were losing. Menelaus knew he couldn't hold the body alone.</p>
        <p>He ran to find Ajax. "Bro, help me. They're gonna take Patroclus to Troy."</p>
        <p>Ajax ran back. He killed a Trojan leader named Hippothous. "Get off him!"</p>
        <p>Then Menelaus dragged the body away. It was gruesome. Blood everywhere.</p>
        <p>Apollo covered the battlefield in a thick fog. It was hard to see. It was chaos.</p>

        


        <h3>The Escape</h3>
        <p>Athena helped Ajax find his way through the fog. He kept killing Trojans who tried to grab the body.</p>
        <p>Hector chased them, but he couldn't stop the Greek tank.</p>
        <p>The Greeks managed to drag Patroclus' body back behind their wall.</p>
        <p>It wasn't a win. It was just damage control.</p>
        <p>Achilles was about to hear the news.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book18">Book 18: The Shield</h2>
        <h3>The News Drops</h3>
        <p>Antilochus ran to Achilles. He was crying. He couldn't look Achilles in the face.</p>
        <p>"Yo, Patroclus..." he choked out. "He's gone. The Trojans wrecked him."</p>
        <p>Achilles went cold. Then he exploded.</p>
        <p>He grabbed dust and poured it over his head. He fell on the ground and wailed. His scream was so loud it shook the tent.</p>
        <p>His mom, Thetis, heard it from the deep ocean. She started screaming too. Her sisters came to comfort her.</p>

        <h3>Thetis & Achilles</h3>
        <p>Thetis flew out of the water. She found Achilles holding Patroclus' body.</p>
        <p>"Why are you crying, son? You're doomed to die young. I know that. But you're still here," she said.</p>
        <p>"Hector killed him," Achilles sobbed. "Patroclus took my armor. I didn't help him. I'm gonna kill Hector. Then I'll die myself. I don't care."</p>
        <p>"But I have no armor!" he said. "Hector has my gear."</p>
        <p>"Don't worry," Thetis said. "I'll get you new stuff. Better stuff. Don't go out yet. Wait."</p>

        


        <h3>The Pushback</h3>
        <p>While the gods were talking, the fight over the body was getting ugly.</p>
        <p>Hector was trying to drag the body to Troy, but Menelaus rallied the Greeks.</p>
        <p>"You really think you're gonna drag him to the city?" Menelaus yelled. "Not on my watch."</p>
        <p>Ajax the Great started throwing rocks. He killed a Trojan leader named Hippothous.</p>
        <p>The Trojans got scared. They couldn't even touch the body without getting speared.</p>
        <p>Apollo stepped in to protect Hector. "Get back, Hector!" he whispered. "The Greeks are crazy right now."</p>

        


        <h3>The Blacksmith</h3>
        <p>Thetis went to Hephaestus, the god of fire and metalworking.</p>
        <p>She found him sweating over his forge. He was making robots for his shop.</p>
        <p>"Son," she said. "My boy needs armor. Now."</p>
        <p>Hephaestus was down. "Your boy saved my life once. I owe you."</p>
        <p>He started working. He put gold, tin, silver, and bronze into the fire.</p>

        <h3>The Shield of Achilles</h3>
        <p>Hephaestus made a shield. It wasn't just a shield. It was a masterpiece. He basically painted the world on it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Cosmos:</strong> Earth, sky, sea, sun, moon, and all the stars.</li>
            <li><strong>Two Cities:</strong> One having a wedding and a court case (Peace). One being raided and soldiers fighting (War).</li>
            <li><strong>The Farm:</strong> Plowmen working the fields, reapers cutting wheat, kids stealing grapes.</li>
            <li><strong>The Animals:</strong> Herds of cows being attacked by lions, shepherds and dogs trying to fight back.</li>
            <li><strong>The Dance:</strong> A dance floor with a kid playing the lyre and couples dancing in a circle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He made the armor shiny and gold. He handed it to Thetis.</p>
        <p>She flew back down to earth. "Suit up," she told Achilles. "It's time."</p>

        


        <h2 id="book19">Book 19: The Re-entry</h2>
        <h3>The Glow Up</h3>
        <p>Thetis brought the new gear to Achilles. She dropped it on the ground. It shone like a fire.</p>
        <p>It was loud. The metal clanked. The Myrmidons (Achilles' squad) were scared to even look at it. They scattered.</p>
        <p>But Achilles couldn't take his eyes off it. It was rage mixed with art.</p>
        <p>He put it on. It fit perfectly. He felt powerful.</p>
        <p>Then he screamed.</p>

        <h3>The Battle Cry</h3>
        <p>Thetis filled the air with nectar so he wouldn't starve too fast.</p>
        <p>Achilles let out a roar. Athena added her voice to it.</p>
        <p>It was terrifying. The Trojans heard it and froze. The Greeks heard it and felt sick.</p>
        <p>The sound made 12 Trojans fall off their chariots just from the fright.</p>

        <h3>The Huddle</h3>
        <p>Achilles called the Greek leaders together. He didn't want to fight anymore. He wanted to squash the beef so they could focus on Hector.</p>
        <p>"Agamemnon," Achilles said. "We fought over a girl. It was dumb. But I'm over it. Let's move."</p>
        <p>"Are we sending the army out or nah?"</p>

        


        <h3>The "My Bad"</h3>
        <p>Agamemnon stood up from his seat. "Yo, listen everyone. It wasn't my fault. It was Zeus. He blinded me."</p>
        <p>"I made a mistake. I want to fix it. I’ll give back the girl. I’ll give the gifts. I’ll throw in extra."</p>
        <p>He called his boys. "Go get the loot. Go get Briseis. Bring it all here."</p>

        <h3>Odysseus Checks Him</h3>
        <p>Odysseus interrupted. "Chill, bro. Don't push the army away just to make a speech."</p>
        <p>Let the men eat first. We can do the whole ceremony with the gifts later. We need to fight NOW.</p>
        <p>Agamemnon agreed. He ordered the Greeks to get a quick meal in.</p>

        


        <h3>Briseis Returns</h3>
        <p>The guards brought Briseis out. She walked toward Achilles.</p>
        <p>But when she saw Patroclus’ body, she lost it.</p>
        <p>She fell on the corpse and cried. "You were like a big brother to me," she sobbed. "Achilles is my husband, but you were nice to me. You treated me like a queen."</p>
        <p>All the women wailed with her. Achilles joined in. It was a sad scene.</p>

        <h3>Zero Patience</h3>
        <p>Zeus was watching. He let out thunder.</p>
        <p>Athena flew down. She poured sweet nectar into Achilles' chest. He didn't even know she did it.</p>
        <p>He strapped on his armor. He grabbed his massive spear.</p>
        <p>"I'm done talking," he said. "I'm going for Hector."</p>

        


        <h2 id="book20">Book 20: God Mode</h2>
        <h3>The God Summit</h3>
        <p>Zeus looked down from Olympus. He saw Achilles in that new shiny armor.</p>
        <p>He called the gods. "Listen up," he said. "I know you all want to jump in. Today is the day."</p>
        <p>"Side with whoever you want. Help the Greeks or the Trojans. But if I see any god trying to play both sides, I'm throwing them into the dark pit."</p>
        <p>The gods rushed down. It was a full-on street fight now.</p>

        <h3>Team Greek vs Team Troy</h3>
        <p>The gods picked their squads.</p>
        <p>On the Trojan side: Ares, Apollo, Artemis, Leto, Xanthus (the river god).</p>
        <p>On the Greek side: Hera, Athena, Poseidon, Hermes, and Hephaestus.</p>
        <p>They stood on the hill overlooking the battlefield, shaking the earth just by standing there.</p>

        


        <h3>Achilles Enters the Chat</h3>
        <p>Achilles stepped out. His armor looked like fire.</p>
        <p>He wasn't just fighting anymore. He was looking for Hector specifically.</p>
        <p>Aeneas, a Trojan hero, saw him. He stepped up to the plate.</p>
        <p>"Let's see if you're all talk," Aeneas said.</p>
        <p>"Aeneas?" Achilles said. "You think you can take me? Last time you ran from me."</p>
        <p>Aeneas dropped some history on him. "My mom is Aphrodite. I'm not scared."</p>

        <h3>The Fight</h3>
        <p>They threw spears. They threw rocks. It was intense.</p>
        <p>Achilles was about to spear Aeneas in the throat. But Poseidon was watching. He loves Aeneas because he's a descendant of his own kid.</p>
        <p>Poseidon threw a magical mist. He swooped in, lifted Aeneas up, and threw him out of the danger zone.</p>
        <p>"You're dumb," Poseidon said to Aeneas. "Why fight a demigod? Go find some weaker soldiers."</p>
        <p>Aeneas landed back in his squad.</p>

        


        <h3>Rampage Begins</h3>
        <p>Achilles was furious his kill got stolen. He started killing everyone else.</p>
        <p>"You die. And you. You too."</p>
        <p>He saw Hector's brother, Polydorus, trying to run.</p>
        <p>Achilles threw a spear and stabbed him right in the back. Polydorus fell with his guts hanging out.</p>
        <p>Hector saw this. That was his little brother.</p>
        <p>Hector got hype. He rushed Achilles, even though Apollo was whispering, "Bro, don't do it."</p>

        <h3>The Chase</h3>
        <p>Hector threw his spear. It hit Achilles' shield perfectly, but the shield was Hephaestus-made. It didn't break.</p>
        <p>Achilles threw his back. It hit Hector's helmet but glanced off.</p>
        <p>Achilles cursed the gods for saving Hector.</p>
        <p>Hector turned to run. But Achilles was fast. He chased him.</p>
        <p>Most of the Trojans bailed. They ran into the river Xanthus to hide in the water.</p>
        <p>Achilles followed them into the river. He didn't care. He was going to kill them all.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book21">Book 21: The River Fight</h2>
        <h3>The River gets Clogged</h3>
        <p>Achilles chased the Trojans into the River Xanthus. He left his chariot and went crazy on foot.</p>
        <p>He was grabbing guys, throwing them in the water, and spearing them.</p>
        <p>He told the survivors: "Hey, all you Trojans. I'm not letting you leave. This river is a one-way trip."</p>
        <p>He took 12 young men and dragged them to the riverbank to kill them as a sacrifice.</p>

        <h3>The River God Gets Salty</h3>
        <p>There were so many dead bodies that the river was jammed. The water turned red.</p>
        <p>The River God, Xanthus, was disgusted. "Bro, you're polluting my stream. Get these corpses out of here!"</p>
        <p>Achilles didn't care. "I'll fill this whole river with dead bodies before I stop."</p>
        <p>The River God got heated. He rose up like a dark wave. He screamed.</p>
        <p>"You're too cocky. You don't respect nature. Watch this."</p>

        


        <h3>The Wave</h3>
        <p>The river churned. Giant waves hit Achilles. The current was so strong it knocked him off his feet.</p>
        <p>Achilles tried to run, but the mud was thick. He couldn't move fast.</p>
        <p>The river kept hitting him. "Drown him!" the river yelled.</p>
        <p>Achilles looked at the sky. "Zeus! Nobody is helping me! My mom went home. Hephaestus, help me!"</p>

        <h3>Fire vs Water</h3>
        <p>Hephaestus, the god of fire, heard him. He started a massive blaze. He aimed at the river.</p>
        <p>Fire met water. It looked like a sci-fi movie. The reeds burned. The fish were frying.</p>
        <p>The river was screaming. "Stop! It burns! I give up!"</p>
        <p>The river stopped attacking Achilles. It pleaded. "I won't help the Trojans anymore. I swear."</p>
        <p>Hephaestus stopped the fire.</p>

        


        <h3>The God Brawl</h3>
        <p>While the river was fighting Achilles, the gods were fighting each other on the side.</p>
        <p>Ares challenged Athena. He was still salty about the time she cut him.</p>
        <p>He threw a spear. Athena grabbed a rock and smashed him in the head.</p>
        <p>Ares crumbled. Armor went flying. He looked like a giant balloon deflating. Athena laughed.</p>
        <p>Aphrodite tried to help Ares. But Hera punched her in the chest. "You stay out of this."</p>
        <p>Aphrodite fell. Apollo stood there, not throwing hands, just talking trash.</p>

        <h3>The Gate Escape</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, the remaining Trojans were running for their lives.</p>
        <p>The Greeks were slaughtering them. Apollo saw Prince Agenor running.</p>
        <p>Apollo possessed Agenor. He turned around and stood in front of Achilles.</p>
        <p>"Come get me!" Apollo shouted.</p>
        <p>Achilles chased him. While Achilles was distracted, the rest of the Trojans ran inside the city gates.</p>
        <p>The gates slammed shut. They were safe for now.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book22">Book 22: The Kill Shot</h2>
        <h3>The Trick</h3>
        <p>The Trojans were hiding inside the city walls. Only Hector was left outside.</p>
        <p>Apollo, who was posing as a Trojan, appeared to Hector.</p>
        <p>"Hey, why are you chasing Achilles? You're just running in circles," Apollo said.</p>
        <p>But then Apollo revealed himself. "Peace out," he said, and vanished.</p>
        <p>Hector realized he had been played. He stood there, alone.</p>

        <h3>The Plea</h3>
        <p>Old King Priam saw Achilles walking toward the city. He saw the look in Achilles' eyes. It was the look of death.</p>
        <p>"Hector!" Priam screamed from the wall. "Please, come inside! You're the only hope left for this city. Don't throw your life away!"</p>
        <p>His mom, Hecuba, started crying. She showed her breast. "Hector, have mercy on me! Don't let him kill you!"</p>
        <p>But Hector stood firm. He couldn't leave. He was too embarrassed.</p>

        


        <h3>The Chase</h3>
        <p>Achilles got closer. Hector's courage faded.</p>
        <p>"Oh snap," Hector thought. "I'm done for."</p>
        <p>He dropped his shield and turned to run. Achilles took off after him.</p>
        <p>They didn't run in a straight line. They ran around the city walls. Three full laps.</p>
        <p>It wasn't a race. It was a hunt. Achilles was a cheetah. Hector was a stag trying to escape.</p>

        <h3>The Gods' Commentary</h3>
        <p>Zeus was watching. "Should we save Hector?" he asked the other gods.</p>
        <p>"He's a good guy. He burns sacrifices to us."</p>
        <p>Athena snapped. "Dad, stop. Hector is dead meat. His time is up."</p>
        <p>Zeus agreed. "Bet. Do what you want."</p>

        


        <h3>The Fake Out</h3>
        <p>Hector was exhausted. Achilles was like the Terminator—he never got tired.</p>
        <p>Athena appeared to Hector in the form of his brother, Deiphobus.</p>
        <p>"Bro!" the fake brother said. "Let's stand together. We can take him."</p>
        <p>Hector was hyped. He stopped running.</p>
        <p>"Deiphobus, you’re the real MVP for standing with me," Hector said.</p>

        <h3>The Final Stand</h3>
        <p>Hector yelled at Achilles. "I'm done running. Let's end this. We agree, winner strips the loser's armor and gives the body back. No disrespect."</p>
        <p>Achilles laughed. "Are you high? I can't promise you that. I'm gonna kill you, strip you, and let the dogs eat you."</p>
        <p>He threw his spear. It went right through Hector's neck.</p>

        <h3>The End</h3>
        <p>Hector fell. "I see you now," he whispered. "You tricked me, Athena. You weren't my brother."</p>
        <p>"Die happy," Achilles said. "They can't save you."</p>
        <p>Hector died. His soul fled to Hades.</p>
        <p>Achilles stripped Hector of his armor. The good armor—the armor he stole from Patroclus.</p>

        <h3>The Dragging</h3>
        <p>Achilles pierced Hector's heels with leather straps. He tied the ropes to his chariot.</p>
        <p>He whipped the horses. The chariot zoomed off. Hector's head bumped and dragged through the dust.</p>
        <p>His wife, Andromache, saw it from the wall. She dropped the veil she was wearing. She fainted.</p>
        <p>The whole city screamed. It was the darkest day of the war.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book23">Book 23: The Funeral Games</h2>
        <h3>The Pyre</h3>
        <p>Achilles didn't go to sleep. He stayed by the body, crying.</p>
        <p>He cut his hair. He laid it on Patroclus' chest.</p>
        <p>"I promised you, bro," he said. "I got Hector. Now you go."</p>
        <p>They built a massive pyre. It was huge. On top, they put the body. Then Achilles killed sheep, oxen, and fat goats. He burned it all.</p>
        <p>He also killed the 12 Trojan prisoners he caught earlier. Cold-blooded.</p>
        <p>"Go with him," he said. "Serve my bestie in the afterlife."</p>

        <h3>The Games Begin</h3>
        <p>The next day, the ashes were gathered. Then Achilles said, "Let's have a tournament. Prizes for the winners."</p>
        <p>The whole army gathered.</p>

        


        <h3>Event 1: Chariot Race (The Grand Prix)</h3>
        <p>Drivers lined up. Eumelus, Diomedes, Menelaus, Antilochus, and Meriones.</p>
        <p>They took off. Eumelus was winning, but Diomedes had the fastest horses.</p>
        <p>Athena helped Diomedes. She smashed Eumelus' chariot. He crashed.</p>
        <p>Diomedes crossed the line first. He won a cauldron and a woman.</p>
        <p>Antilochus came second. He won a mare. But Menelaus was salty.</p>
        <p>"You cut me off!" Menelaus yelled. "That was a dirty move."</p>
        <p>Antilochus apologized. "My bad, boss. I'm young and hype. I'm scared of you. You take the prize."</p>
        <p>Menelaus forgave him because he was chill like that.</p>

        <h3>Event 2: Boxing</h3>
        <p>Epeus stepped up. He flexed. "I got hands. Watch this."</p>
        <p>Euryalus fought him. Epeus hit him with a left hook. Euryalus went down hard.</p>
        <p>KO. He was dragging his feet. His boys had to carry him off.</p>
        <p>Epeus took the mule.</p>

        


        <h3>Event 3: Wrestling</h3>
        <p>Big Ajax vs. Odysseus. Brains vs. Brawn.</p>
        <p>They tried to throw each other. Sweat everywhere. Mud everywhere.</p>
        <p>Odysseus got the takedown, but Ajax tripped him. It was a tie.</p>
        <p>The sun went down. "Stop," Achilles said. "You both win prizes."</p>

        <h3>Event 4: The Footrace</h3>
        <p>Odysseus and Ajax the Lesser (the fast one) were neck and neck.</p>
        <p>Odysseus prayed to Athena.</p>
        <p>Ajax slipped. There was a pile of cow dung (crap) on the track.</p>
        <p>Ajax face-planted into it.</p>
        <p>Odysseus won the race. Ajax came out looking dirty and mad.</p>
        <p>Odysseus laughed. "You talk about speed, but I'm the winner."</p>

        <h3>Event 5: Archery</h3>
        <p>Meriones and Teucer stepped up.</p>
        <p>Achilles set up a dove on a string. Hit the string, win.</p>
        <p>Teucer shot first. He missed the string entirely.</p>
        <p>Meriones shot. He didn't miss. He hit the bird.</p>

        <h3>Event 6: Spear Throwing</h3>
        <p>Agamemnon stood up. "I want to throw."</p>
        <p>Achilles stopped him. "We know you're the strongest boss. You don't need to prove it. Just take the prize."</p>
        <p>So Agamemnon got the trophy without sweating. VIP treatment.</p>

        


        <h2 id="book24">Book 24: The Ransom</h2>
        <h3>The Gods Step In</h3>
        <p>The gods were watching Achilles. He was still dragging Hector’s body around every day. It was disrespectful and cruel.</p>
        <p>Apollo stood up. "Yo, this isn't right. He's treating a corpse like trash. Someone needs to tell him to stop."</p>
        <p>But Hera was mad. "He's the enemy! He killed Patroclus!"</p>
        <p>Zeus silenced them. "Both of you chill. I love Hector too. I’m gonna fix this."</p>
        <p>He sent Iris, the messenger, to Thetis (Achilles' mom).</p>
        <p>"Go tell Achilles," Zeus said. "I'm not happy with his behavior. He needs to return the body for ransom."</p>

        <h3>The Secret Mission</h3>
        <p>Then Zeus sent Iris to Priam, the old King of Troy.</p>
        <p>"Pack a bag of gold," she told him. "Go to the Greek camp at night. Don't bring anyone. Beg Achilles for your son."</p>
        <p>Priam was scared but determined. He grabbed the finest treasure in Troy.</p>
        <p>Hermes, the god of thieves and travelers, came down to guide him. He was invisible.</p>
        <p>They walked past the Greek guards. Hermes put them all to sleep. It was magical.</p>

        


        <h3>The Confrontation</h3>
        <p>They reached Achilles' tent. Achilles was still awake, staring at the sea.</p>
        <p>Priam walked in and didn't say a word. He ran to Achilles.</p>
        <p>He grabbed Achilles' knees. He kissed his hands—the hands that had killed his sons.</p>
        <p>"Remember your dad, Achilles," Priam cried. "He's old and scared like me. But he's happy because you're alive."</p>
        <p>"I lost everything. Hector was my best boy. Give him back."</p>

        <h3>The Tears</h3>
        <p>Achilles looked at the old man. He thought of his own dad, Peleus. He thought of Patroclus.</p>
        <p>He started crying. Priam cried too. It was a scene. Two warriors losing it together.</p>
        <p>Enough tears to fill a cup.</p>
        <p>"You got more guts than any army," Achilles said. "Get up. Sit down."</p>
        <p>"I know Hector was a good guy. He loved his family. I'm sorry for what I did."</p>

        


        <h3>The Respect</h3>
        <p>Achilles washed Hector’s body. He wrapped it in a nice cloth. He put it on a bier (a funeral bed).</p>
        <p>He called his crew. "Wash the chariot. Bring the body out."</p>
        <p>Briseis (the girl who started the beef) was there too. She cried when she saw Hector.</p>
        <p>"He was always good to me," she said.</p>

        <h3>The Truce</h3>
        <p>Achilles told Priam: "You can take him. I'll give you a truce for 11 days. You guys bury Hector. Then we fight again."</p>
        <p>Priam paid the ransom. It was a mountain of gold.</p>
        <p>Hermes guided Priam safely back to the city before anyone woke up.</p>

        <h3>The Funeral</h3>
        <p>Andromache, Helen, and Hecuba saw the body. They screamed.</p>
        <p>For 9 days, they mourned. On the 10th, they burned the pyre.</p>
        <p>They put out the fire with wine. His brothers collected the bones and put them in a golden chest.</p>
        <p>The city had a huge feast.</p>
        <p>That was the end of Hector.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center; color:#666; margin-top:40px;">End of The Iliad</p>
