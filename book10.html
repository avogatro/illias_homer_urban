        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 10</p>

        <h2>Bad Vibes Only</h2>
        <p>The Greeks were stressed. Agamemnon couldn't sleep. He was pacing the tent, sweating bullets.</p>
        <p>He put on his gear and went to check on the guards. He found Nestor.</p>
        <p>"Nestor," he whispered. "I'm freaking out. We're losing. We need a plan."</p>
        <p>Nestor agreed. "Let's send scouts. See what the Trojans are plotting at night."</p>

        <h2>The Dynamic Duo</h2>
        <p>"Who's down for a sneak mission?" Nestor asked.</p>
        <p>Diomedes stood up. "I got this. I'm not scared of the dark."</p>
        <p>"Pick a homie to go with you," Nestor said.</p>
        <p>Diomedes chose Odysseus immediately. "He's smart. He's got the best ideas."</p>
        <p>They walked out of camp. They were basically in stealth mode. They were like shadows.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Snitch</h2>
        <p>Hector was also on his grind. He asked for a volunteer to spy on the Greeks.</p>
        <p>A guy named Dolon raised his hand. "I'll go. But I want Achilles' chariot and his horses as a payment."</p>
        <p>Hector agreed. Dolon put on a weasel-skin cap and started creeping toward the Greek ships.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Diomedes and Odysseus saw him coming.</p>
        <p>"Yo, someone is coming," Odysseus whispered. "Let's hide and jump him."</p>
        <p>They waited. Dolon walked right past them.</p>
        <p>Diomedes lunged. *Gotcha.* He pinned him to the ground.</p>

        <h2>The Interrogation</h2>
        <p>Dolon was crying. "Don't kill me! I'm rich! I'm Hector's messenger!"</p>
        <p>Odysseus grabbed him. "Listen. Don't lie. Are you spying? Where's Hector sleeping? Who are the Trojans camped with?"</p>
        <p>Dolon spilled everything. He was singing like a bird.</p>
        <p>"Hector is near the ships. But the Thracians are the ones you want. They just showed up. Their King, Rhesus, has the craziest white horses. They are faster than the wind. Golden armor too."</p>

        <h2>The Takeout</h2>
        <p>Odysseus looked at Diomedes. "You heard the man. Let's go get those horses."</p>
        <p>But first—*Chop.* Diomedes killed Dolon. Cold-blooded.</p>
        <p>They crept over to the Thracian camp. Everyone was asleep, passed out after drinking.</p>
        <p>It was a massacre. Diomedes moved through the tents like a ghost. He killed 12 Thracians in their sleep.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Getaway</h2>
        <p>Diomedes got to King Rhesus. He sliced the King's throat while he dreamed.</p>
        <p>Odysseus grabbed the white horses. He had to untie them.</p>
        <p>Athena helped them out. She told them to bounce.</p>
        <p>They rode the horses back to the Greek ships. It looked sick.</p>

        <h2>Safe & Sound</h2>
        <p>They got back to base and washed the blood off in the ocean.</p>
        <p>They sat in Agamemnon's tent. "Look what we got," Diomedes said.</p>
        <p>They sacrificed a horse to Athena. Everyone ate some food.</p>
        <p>While the Greeks celebrated the loot, the Trojans were waking up to a nightmare. The King was dead. The horses were gone. Panic spread.</p>
        <p>It was a W for the Greeks.</p>
