        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 21</p>

        <h2>The River gets Clogged</h2>
        <p>Achilles chased the Trojans into the River Xanthus. He left his chariot and went crazy on foot.</p>
        <p>He was grabbing guys, throwing them in the water, and spearing them.</p>
        <p>He told the survivors: "Hey, all you Trojans. I'm not letting you leave. This river is a one-way trip."</p>
        <p>He took 12 young men and dragged them to the riverbank to kill them as a sacrifice.</p>

        <h2>The River God Gets Salty</h2>
        <p>There were so many dead bodies that the river was jammed. The water turned red.</p>
        <p>The River God, Xanthus, was disgusted. "Bro, you're polluting my stream. Get these corpses out of here!"</p>
        <p>Achilles didn't care. "I'll fill this whole river with dead bodies before I stop."</p>
        <p>The River God got heated. He rose up like a dark wave. He screamed.</p>
        <p>"You're too cocky. You don't respect nature. Watch this."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Wave</h2>
        <p>The river churned. Giant waves hit Achilles. The current was so strong it knocked him off his feet.</p>
        <p>Achilles tried to run, but the mud was thick. He couldn't move fast.</p>
        <p>The river kept hitting him. "Drown him!" the river yelled.</p>
        <p>Achilles looked at the sky. "Zeus! Nobody is helping me! My mom went home. Hephaestus, help me!"</p>

        <h2>Fire vs Water</h2>
        <p>Hephaestus, the god of fire, heard him. He started a massive blaze. He aimed at the river.</p>
        <p>Fire met water. It looked like a sci-fi movie. The reeds burned. The fish were frying.</p>
        <p>The river was screaming. "Stop! It burns! I give up!"</p>
        <p>The river stopped attacking Achilles. It pleaded. "I won't help the Trojans anymore. I swear."</p>
        <p>Hephaestus stopped the fire.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The God Brawl</h2>
        <p>While the river was fighting Achilles, the gods were fighting each other on the side.</p>
        <p>Ares challenged Athena. He was still salty about the time she cut him.</p>
        <p>He threw a spear. Athena grabbed a rock and smashed him in the head.</p>
        <p>Ares crumbled. Armor went flying. He looked like a giant balloon deflating. Athena laughed.</p>
        <p>Aphrodite tried to help Ares. But Hera punched her in the chest. "You stay out of this."</p>
        <p>Aphrodite fell. Apollo stood there, not throwing hands, just talking trash.</p>

        <h2>The Gate Escape</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, the remaining Trojans were running for their lives.</p>
        <p>The Greeks were slaughtering them. Apollo saw Prince Agenor running.</p>
        <p>Apollo possessed Agenor. He turned around and stood in front of Achilles.</p>
        <p>"Come get me!" Apollo shouted.</p>
        <p>Achilles chased him. While Achilles was distracted, the rest of the Trojans ran inside the city gates.</p>
        <p>The gates slammed shut. They were safe for now.</p>
