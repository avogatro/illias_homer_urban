        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 16</p>

        <h2>The Begging</h2>
        <p>Patroclus couldn't watch anymore. The Greeks were getting cooked right in front of their ships.</p>
        <p>He ran to Achilles, tears in his eyes. "Bro, look at them! They’re dying. If you won't fight, let me wear your armor. Maybe if the Trojans see *you*, they'll get scared."</p>
        <p>Achilles looked at him. He was torn. He still hated Agamemnon, but he loved Patroclus.</p>
        <p>"Fine," Achilles said. "Take my team. Take my gear. But listen close."</p>
        <p>"Push them back from the ships. That's it. Do NOT chase them all the way to the city. If you get cocky, you might catch a stray. I need you alive."</p>

        <h2>The Glitch</h2>
        <p>Patroclus suited up. He looked exactly like Achilles. He put the Myrmidons in the chariots.</p>
        <p>They stormed out of camp like a tidal wave.</p>
        <p>The Trojans saw him and froze. "Oh snap! It's Achilles! He's back!"</p>
        <p>The Trojans panicked. They thought the tank was back in the game. They started running immediately.</p>
        <p>Patroclus was eating them up. He killed like 5 guys in the first minute.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Sarpedon Dies</h2>
        <p>Zeus watched his son, Sarpedon, fighting Patroclus.</p>
        <p>Zeus wanted to save him. But Hera checked him. "If you save your son, all the other gods are gonna want to save their favorites. It'll break the game."</p>
        <p>Zeus sighed. He rained bloody tears on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Patroclus threw his spear. *THUNK.* Right through Sarpedon's heart. The Lycian king fell.</p>
        <p>His buddy Glaucus saw it and screamed. "Avenge the King!"</p>
        <p>There was a huge fight over the body. But the Greeks grabbed Sarpedon's gear and dragged him away. Zeus sent Apollo to clean the body and take it back to Troy for a proper funeral.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Pride (Hubris)</h2>
        <p>Patroclus was winning too much. He forgot the rules.</p>
        <p>He killed the guy who stabbed Odysseus earlier. He killed Hector’s driver.</p>
        <p>He kept pushing and pushing. He went past the wall. He went past the trench. He was right at the gates of Troy.</p>
        <p>He was trying to storm the castle alone. Apollo saw this and was not impressed.</p>

        <h2>The Check</h2>
        <p>Apollo walked up behind Patroclus. "Sit down, son," he said.</p>
        <p>He slapped Patroclus' back so hard his helmet spun around. His shield fell off. He was stunned.</p>
        <p>A random Trojan named Euphorbus saw his chance. He threw a spear and stuck Patroclus in the back.</p>
        <p>Hector rode up on his chariot. He saw the great warrior down.</p>
        <p>Hector shouted, "You thought you could sack Troy? Watch this."</p>
        <p>He stabbed Patroclus right in the gut with a spear.</p>
        <p>Patroclus looked him in the eye. "You got me, but you didn't kill a random. I was wearing Achilles' armor. And Hector? You're next. You're days are numbered."</p>
        <p>Patroclus died.</p>
        <p>The war had just gotten personal.</p>
