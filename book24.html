        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 24</p>

        <h2>The Gods Step In</h2>
        <p>The gods were watching Achilles. He was still dragging Hector’s body around every day. It was disrespectful and cruel.</p>
        <p>Apollo stood up. "Yo, this isn't right. He's treating a corpse like trash. Someone needs to tell him to stop."</p>
        <p>But Hera was mad. "He's the enemy! He killed Patroclus!"</p>
        <p>Zeus silenced them. "Both of you chill. I love Hector too. I’m gonna fix this."</p>
        <p>He sent Iris, the messenger, to Thetis (Achilles' mom).</p>
        <p>"Go tell Achilles," Zeus said. "I'm not happy with his behavior. He needs to return the body for ransom."</p>

        <h2>The Secret Mission</h2>
        <p>Then Zeus sent Iris to Priam, the old King of Troy.</p>
        <p>"Pack a bag of gold," she told him. "Go to the Greek camp at night. Don't bring anyone. Beg Achilles for your son."</p>
        <p>Priam was scared but determined. He grabbed the finest treasure in Troy.</p>
        <p>Hermes, the god of thieves and travelers, came down to guide him. He was invisible.</p>
        <p>They walked past the Greek guards. Hermes put them all to sleep. It was magical.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Confrontation</h2>
        <p>They reached Achilles' tent. Achilles was still awake, staring at the sea.</p>
        <p>Priam walked in and didn't say a word. He ran to Achilles.</p>
        <p>He grabbed Achilles' knees. He kissed his hands—the hands that had killed his sons.</p>
        <p>"Remember your dad, Achilles," Priam cried. "He's old and scared like me. But he's happy because you're alive."</p>
        <p>"I lost everything. Hector was my best boy. Give him back."</p>

        <h2>The Tears</h2>
        <p>Achilles looked at the old man. He thought of his own dad, Peleus. He thought of Patroclus.</p>
        <p>He started crying. Priam cried too. It was a scene. Two warriors losing it together.</p>
        <p>Enough tears to fill a cup.</p>
        <p>"You got more guts than any army," Achilles said. "Get up. Sit down."</p>
        <p>"I know Hector was a good guy. He loved his family. I'm sorry for what I did."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Respect</h2>
        <p>Achilles washed Hector’s body. He wrapped it in a nice cloth. He put it on a bier.</p>
        <p>He called his crew. "Wash the chariot. Bring the body out."</p>
        <p>Briseis (the girl who started the beef) was there too. She cried when she saw Hector.</p>
        <p>"He was always good to me," she said.</p>

        <h2>The Truce</h2>
        <p>Achilles told Priam: "You can take him. I'll give you a truce for 11 days. You guys bury Hector. Then we fight again."</p>
        <p>Priam paid the ransom. It was a mountain of gold.</p>
        <p>Hermes guided Priam safely back to the city before anyone woke up.</p>

        <h2>The Funeral</h2>
        <p>Andromache, Helen, and Hecuba saw the body. They screamed.</p>
        <p>For 9 days, they mourned. On the 10th, they burned the pyre.</p>
        <p>They put out the fire with wine. His brothers collected the bones and put them in a golden chest.</p>
        <p>The city had a huge feast.</p>
        <p>That was the end of Hector.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center; color:#666; margin-top:40px;">End of The Iliad</p>
