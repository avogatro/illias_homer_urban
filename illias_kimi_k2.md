# BOOK I

Yo, this is the story of Achilles' rage.

That dude was furious. His anger caused mad problems for the Greeks. Countless soldiers died. Their bodies fed the dogs and vultures. All because he had beef with Agamemnon.

It started with Apollo. He was angry at Agamemnon. The god sent a plague. The Greek camp was dying.

Here's why:

Chryses was a priest. His daughter got captured. He came to the Greek ships. He brought a huge ransom. He begged for her back. He held Apollo's staff. He asked nicely.

"Please," he said. "Let my daughter go. Respect Apollo."

Most Greeks agreed. They wanted to take the ransom. But not Agamemnon.

Agamemnon was rude. "Old man, get lost," he said. "I'm keeping her. She'll age in my house. She'll work my loom. She'll share my bed. Now leave."

Chryses was scared. He walked away. He prayed to Apollo by the sea.

"Hear me," he cried. "If I ever honored you, get revenge. Punish the Greeks."

Apollo listened. He came down from Olympus. His bow was ready. His arrows rattled. He looked dark as night.

He sat away from the ships. He started shooting. First the mules and dogs. Then the people. The funeral pyres burned all day.

Nine days passed. Achilles called a meeting. Juno told him to. She felt bad for the Greeks.

"Agamemnon," Achilles said. "We need to leave. We're dying from war and plague. Find a prophet. Ask why Apollo is angry."

Calchas stood up. He was the seer. He knew past, present, future.

"Achilles," he said. "Will you protect me? I'll offend someone powerful."

"Speak," Achilles said. "I swear by Apollo. No one will touch you while I live. Not even Agamemnon."

Calchas spoke. "Apollo is angry because of his priest. Agamemnon dishonored him. He won't free the girl. That's why we suffer."

Agamemnon rose. He was angry. His eyes flashed fire. He scowled at Calchas.

"You always predict evil," he said. "Apollo plagues us because I won't free the girl. Fine. I'll give her back. But find me another prize. I won't be the only one without."

Achilles answered. "How can we find you another? We already divided everything. We took it from captured cities."

Agamemnon said. "You're trying to outwit me. Won't work. If you want me to give her up, find me a replacement. Or I'll take yours. Or Ajax's. Or Odysseus's. Someone will pay."

Achilles was furious. His heart was divided. Should he kill Agamemnon? Or check his anger?

He reached for his sword. But Athena came down. Only he could see her. She grabbed his hair.

"Stop," she said. "Juno sent me. Don't draw your sword. Yell at him if you want. You'll get gifts later. Three times as many."

Achilles obeyed. He put his sword away.

But he kept yelling at Agamemnon. "You're greedy. You're a dog. You're a coward. You never fight. You just steal prizes. We followed you to Troy for YOUR revenge. Not ours. And now you threaten to take MY prize? The one I earned?"

Agamemnon responded. "Fly home if you want. I don't care. I have others who honor me. Since Apollo takes Chryseis, I'll send her back. But I'll take Briseis from your tent. You'll learn who's stronger."

Achilles was stunned. He went back to his ships. He sat by the sea. He cried. He called his mother.

"Mom," he said. "Agamemnon dishonored me. He took my prize."

Thetis heard him. She rose from the sea like mist. She sat before him.

"Son," she said. "Why are you weeping?"

"You know," Achilles said. "We captured cities. We divided the spoils. Agamemnon got Chryseis. Her father came to ransom her. Most Greeks agreed. But Agamemnon refused. Apollo sent a plague. Calchas explained why. Agamemnon had to give her back. Now he's taking MY girl, Briseis, as compensation. Help me."

Thetis wept. "Your life is short. Full of sorrow. But I'll go to Olympus. I'll talk to Zeus. He owes me. I saved him once. The other gods tried to bind him. I rescued him. I'll ask him to help the Trojans. To make the Greeks lose. Until they give you honor."

"Go," Achilles said. "I'll stay by my ships. I won't fight."

Thetis left. She went to Olympus. She found Zeus alone. She grabbed his knees. She caught his chin.

"Father Zeus," she said. "Honor my son. His life will be cut short. Agamemnon dishonored him. Give victory to the Trojans. Make the Greeks suffer. Until they give Achilles respect."

Zeus was silent. He sat for a while.

Thetis held on. "Promise me," she said. "Or deny me."

Zeus was troubled. "This will cause problems. Juno will be mad. She already accuses me of helping Trojans. But okay. I promise."

He bowed his head. His dark brows moved. Olympus reeled.

They parted. Zeus went home. Thetis returned to the sea.

The gods rose when Zeus arrived. They all stood. Juno saw him. She knew he'd been talking to Thetis.

"Trickster," she said. "What were you planning? You always scheme behind my back."

"Juno," Zeus said. "You can't know all my plans. I'm the king. When it's proper, you'll know. When I want secrets, don't pry."

Juno answered. "I don't pry. But I know Thetis was holding your knees. You promised to glorify Achilles. To kill Greeks."

Zeus replied. "You're suspicious. It gets you nowhere. Sit down. Be quiet. Or I'll get angry."

Juno was scared. She sat down. She stayed silent.

The gods were uneasy. Hephaestus spoke up. He tried to calm his mother.

"Don't fight," he said. "You'll ruin the feast. Make peace with dad. He's the strongest. Use fair words."

He gave his mother a cup of nectar. "Cheer up. I love you. But you can't fight Zeus. He threw me off Olympus once. I fell all day. Landed in Lemnos. Barely alive."

Juno smiled. She took the cup.

Hephaestus served the gods nectar. They laughed. They applauded.

Apollo played his lyre. The Muses sang. They called and answered.

The feast continued. When the sun set, they went home.

Zeus slept. Juno slept beside him.

The gods rested.

But the Greeks? Their problems were just beginning.

**End of Book I**

# BOOK II

Zeus sent a fake dream to Agamemnon.

The dream looked like Nestor. It went to Agamemnon's tent. Agamemnon was sleeping hard.

"Wake up," the dream said. "Zeus sent me. Get the Greeks ready for battle. You'll take Troy today. The gods finally agree. Juno changed her mind. The Trojans are doomed."

The dream left. Agamemnon woke up. He believed the lie. He thought he'd win that day. He didn't know Zeus planned otherwise.

Agamemnon got dressed. He put on his soft shirt. His heavy cloak. His sandals. His sword. He grabbed his royal staff.

Dawn came up. Agamemnon sent heralds to call the troops. He held a council first. At Nestor's ship. The elders came.

"Listen," Agamemnon said. "Zeus sent me a dream. Looked like Nestor. Said we'll take Troy today. Let's get ready. But first I'll test the men. I'll tell them to go home. You stop them."

He sat down. Nestor stood up.

"If anyone else told this dream," Nestor said, "I'd call it fake. But it's you. We must prepare."

They left the council. The troops gathered. Thousands of them. Like bees from a cave. Like flocks of birds. The shore was packed.

Nine heralds yelled for silence. The men finally sat down.

Agamemnon stood. He leaned on his staff. He looked like a king.

"Friends," he said. "Zeus lied to me. He promised I'd sack Troy. Now he says go home empty-handed. Nine years wasted. Our ships are rotting. Our families wait at home. We can't take Troy. The Trojans have allies. Let's leave."

He was testing them. But most didn't know.

The crowd erupted. They rushed to the ships. Like waves crashing. Like wind through corn. They yelled with joy.

"Let's go home!" they shouted. They grabbed the ship supports. They cleared the channels.

The Greeks would have left. But Juno wasn't having it.

She turned to Athena. "Are we letting them go? Leaving Helen with the Trojans? After all these deaths?"

Athena agreed. She zoomed down from Olympus. She found Odysseus. He was just standing there. He hadn't moved his ship.

"What's up?" Athena said. "You're going home? Leaving Helen?"

Odysseus knew her voice. He dropped his cloak. Ran to Agamemnon. Grabbed his royal staff.

He used it like a weapon. When he found a king or chief, he spoke nice.

"Hold up," he said. "This is cowardly. Stay at your post. Agamemnon was testing us. He'll be pissed if we leave. King's pride is strong."

But when he found a regular soldier yelling, he hit him.

"Shut up," Odysseus said. "You're nobody. Listen to your betters. We can't all be kings. One ruler is enough."

He went through the crowd like a boss. The men returned to assembly. They sat down. The noise stopped.

But one dude kept talking. Thersites. He was the ugliest man at Troy. Bandy-legged. Lame foot. Hunched back. Pointy head. Bald on top.

He loved chaos. He insulted everyone. Especially the kings.

"Agamemnon!" he yelled. "What's your problem? Your tents are full of bronze and women. Still want more? We should sail home. Let Agamemnon rot here. Achilles is better anyway. Look how Agamemnon treated him. Took his prize. And Achilles just took it."

Odysseus walked up to him. "Shut your mouth," he said. "You're the worst man here. Always talking trash. If I catch you again, I'll strip you naked and whip you out of here."

He hit Thersites with the staff. Raised a bloody welt. Thersites sat down. Crying. The troops laughed.

"Odysseus just did us a solid," they said.

Odysseus stood up. Athena made everyone quiet.

"Agamemnon," he said. "The troops want to make you look bad. They want to go home. They forgot their oath. They're acting like children. We promised to take Troy. It's been nine years. I get it. They're tired. But going home empty would be shameful."

"Remember Aulis? We were stuck there. We saw a sign from Zeus. A snake ate nine baby birds. Calchas said it meant we'd fight nine years and take Troy in the tenth. It's all coming true. Stay."

The troops roared approval.

Nestor stood up. "Let's stop talking. Get to battle. Organize by tribes. That way we see who's brave and who's not."

Agamemnon said. "Nestor, you're wise. I wish I had ten more like you. But Zeus keeps messing with me. The Achilles beef hurts us. If we were united, Troy would fall."

He turned to the troops. "Eat now. Sharpen your spears. Check your shields. Feed your horses. Prepare your chariots. Anyone who hangs back at the ships will die. No excuses."

They cheered. Like waves on rocks.

They ran to their ships. Lit fires. Cooked meals. Sacrificed to gods.

Agamemnon killed a fat bull for Zeus. He called the chiefs: Nestor, Idomeneus, Ajax, Diomedes, Odysseus. Menelaus came too.

They stood around the bull. Agamemnon prayed: "Zeus, don't let the sun set until Troy burns. Let me kill Hector. Let many Trojans die."

Zeus heard. But he didn't grant the prayer. He accepted the sacrifice but planned more war.

They killed the bull. Cut the thigh bones. Wrapped them in fat. Burned them. Spitted the meat. Roasted it.

They ate. They were satisfied.

After eating, Nestor said: "Agamemnon, let's organize the troops. By tribes. By clans."

"You're right," Agamemnon said. He sent heralds to gather the men.

The troops formed up. Athena moved among them. She held her aegis shield. It had a hundred golden tassels. Each worth a hundred oxen.

She encouraged everyone. War started looking better than home.

The armor flashed. Like a forest fire on a mountain.

They moved out. Like flocks of geese. Like swarms of flies. The earth groaned.

Now the Muses need to help. There were too many to name. But I'll name the captains.

The Boeotians came. Fifty ships. From places like Hyria, Aulis, Mykalessus, Thebes.

They were led by Peneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, Clonius.

The Minyans came. Thirty ships. From Orchomenus. Led by Ascalaphus and Ialmenus. They were sons of Ares.

The Phocians came. Forty ships. Led by Schedius and Epistrophus. They held places like Pytho, Crisa, Daulis.

Ajax the Lesser led the Locrians. Forty ships. They came from Cynus, Opus, Calliarus.

The Abantes came. Fifty ships. From Euboea. They had long hair. Fierce warriors. Led by Elephenor.

The Athenians came. Fifty ships. Led by Menestheus. No one could match him at organizing troops except Nestor.

Ajax came from Salamis. Twelve ships.

The Argives came. Eighty ships. From Mycenae, Corinth, Epidaurus. Led by Diomedes and Sthenelus. And Euryalus.

Agamemnon led the biggest force. A hundred ships. From Mycenae and the coast. He was the main man.

Menelaus came. Sixty ships. From Lacedaemon. His brother Agamemnon's troops were separate. Menelaus wanted revenge for Helen.

Nestor came. Ninety ships. From Pylos. He ruled three generations. He was old but wise.

The Arcadians came. Sixty ships. Agapenor led them. They weren't sailors. Agamemnon gave them ships.

The Epeans came. Forty ships. From Elis. Four leaders. Ten ships each. Amphimachus. Thalpius. Diores. Polyxenus.

Meges led the Dulichians. Forty ships. From the Echinades. He was son of Phyleus.

Odysseus led the Cephallenians. Twelve ships. From Ithaca, Zacynthus, Samos. He was a strategist.

Thoas led the Aetolians. Forty ships. From Pleuron, Olenus, Pylene, Chalcis, Calydon. Oeneus was dead. Meleager was dead.

Idomeneus led the Cretans. Eighty ships. From a hundred cities. Meriones helped him.

Tlepolemus led the Rhodians. Nine ships. From Lindus, Ielysus, Cameirus. He was Hercules' son. He killed his uncle. Had to flee.

Nireus led three ships from Syme. He was the second most handsome man after Achilles. But weak.

The Carians came. They had weird speech. Led by Nastes and Amphimachus. Nastes wore gold like a girl. Fool. Gold wouldn't save him.

Sarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians. They were allies.

The gods watched. They had their favorites.

Now Iris raced to Troy. She was Zeus' messenger. Fast as wind.

She found the Trojans assembled at Priam's gates. She looked like Priam's son Polites. He was a watchman.

"Old man," she said to Priam. "Stop talking peace. War is here. Look at the Greeks. They're coming. Thick as leaves. Hector, organize the allies."

Hector knew it was a goddess. He dismissed the assembly. The men ran for weapons.

The city gates opened. Troops poured out. Horse and foot.

The allies gathered on a hill. They called it Batieia. The gods called it Myrine's tomb.

Hector commanded the Trojans. Most troops. Best fighters.

Aeneas commanded the Dardanians. Venus' son. With Antenor's sons.

Pandarus led troops from Mt. Ida. Apollo taught him archery.

Adrestus and Amphius led from Adresteia. They were sons of a prophet. He told them not to fight. They didn't listen.

Asius led from Sestos, Abydos, Arisbe. His horses brought him.

Hippothous and Pylaeus led the Pelasgian spearmen. From Larissa.

Acamas and Peirous led the Thracians. From beyond the Hellespont.

Euphemus led the Ciconian spearmen.

Pyraechmes led the Paeonian archers. From Amydon by the Axius river.

Pylaemanes led the Paphlagonians. From Enetae.

Odius and Epistrophus led the Halizoni. From Alybe, where there's silver.

Chromis and Ennomus led the Mysians. Ennomus was a prophet. But prophecy didn't save him.

Phorcys and Ascanius led the Phrygians. From Ascania.

Mesthles and Antiphus led the Meonians. From under Mt. Tmolus.

Nastes and Amphimachus led the Carians. Nastes wore gold like a girl. Achilles would kill him and take it.

The allies were ready.

The Greeks approached.

The dust rose.

War was about to begin.

**End of Book II**

# BOOK III

The armies faced each other.

They were lined up. Ready to go. The Trojans looked like wild fowl. Screaming. The Greeks marched silent. Hearts high.

The dust rose. Like mist on mountains.

Paris stepped forward. He wore panther skin. He had his bow. His sword. Two bronze spears. He challenged the Greeks.

Menelaus saw him. He smiled. Like a hungry lion seeing a goat. He jumped from his chariot. Put on his armor.

Paris saw Menelaus coming. He panicked. He shrank back. Like someone seeing a snake. He hid in the Trojan ranks.

Hector was pissed. "Paris!" he yelled. "You pretty boy. Woman-crazy. Liar. I wish you'd never been born. You started this war. You stole Helen. Brought shame on us. Now you won't even fight her husband? Where's your courage? Your lyre? Your pretty hair? You'll be dead in the dust."

Paris answered. "Hector, you're right. Your words are sharp like an axe. But don't mock the gifts Venus gave me. Gods give what they want. If you want me to fight Menelaus, let's make a deal. Let everyone watch. Winner takes Helen and all her stuff. The loser accepts it."

Hector liked this. He walked through the Trojan lines. Held his spear sideways. Made them sit down.

The Greeks were still throwing stones. Shooting arrows. Ready to fight.

Agamemnon yelled. "Hold up! Hector wants to talk."

The Greeks stopped.

Hector spoke. "Trojans and Greeks. Listen to Paris' idea. He and Menelaus will fight one-on-one. Winner gets Helen and her wealth. The rest of us swear to peace."

Menelaus answered. "I like this. I'm the most wronged here. Let the person who caused this die. Then the rest can have peace. Bring two lambs for sacrifice. One white ram. One black ewe. We'll swear on them."

Both sides were happy. They thought they'd get rest. They backed up their chariots. Took off their armor.

Hector sent two messengers to Troy. Get the lambs. Bring Priam.

Agamemnon sent Talthybius to the ships. Get another lamb.

Meanwhile, Iris went to Helen. She looked like Helen's sister-in-law. Laodice. Priam's daughter. Married to Antenor's son.

She found Helen in her room. Working on a purple tapestry. Showing battles between Trojans and Greeks.

"Come," Iris said. "See what's happening. They're not fighting anymore. Paris and Menelaus are about to duel for you."

Helen's heart ached. She missed her old life. She threw on a white veil. She cried as she went to the city gates. Two handmaids followed.

At the Scaean gates, old men sat. Priam. Panthous. Thymoetes. Lampus. Clytius. Hicetaon.

They were too old to fight. But they could talk.

They saw Helen coming.

"Damn," they whispered. "No wonder they fight. She's unbelievably beautiful."

Priam called her over. "Daughter, sit by me. See your former husband. See your relatives. I don't blame you. The gods do. Tell me, who's that huge Greek? I've seen taller men, but none so royal."

"That's Agamemnon," Helen said. "Good king. Brave warrior. My husband's brother."

Priam looked at Odysseus next. "Who's that shorter man? But broader? He looks like a ram leading sheep."

"That's Odysseus," Helen said. "Full of tricks. From Ithaca. Cleverest man alive."

Antenor spoke up. "He came here once. As an envoy. With Menelaus. I hosted them. Menelaus is broad-shouldered. But Odysseus has more presence. When Menelaus spoke, he was brief but clear. Odysseus would start quiet. Looking down. Holding his staff stiff. Looking like a simpleton. But when he spoke? His voice boomed like winter snow. No one could match him."

Priam saw Ajax next. "Who's that giant?"

"That's huge Ajax," Helen said. "Bulwark of the Greeks. Near him is Idomeneus from Crete. I see many others I could name. But I can't find my brothers. Castor and Pollux. Either they didn't come from Sparta. Or they're ashamed of me."

She didn't know they were already dead. Buried in Lacedaemon.

The messengers returned from Troy. They brought the lambs. Priam came too. He mounted his chariot. Antenor rode with him.

They drove to the plain. The troops made space.

Agamemnon and Odysseus prepared the sacrifice. They brought a mixing bowl. Gold cups.

They poured water on their hands. Agamemnon drew his dagger. Cut wool from the lambs' heads.

He prayed. "Zeus. Sun. Earth. Rivers. Underworld gods who punish oath-breakers. Witness this. If Paris kills Menelaus, he keeps Helen. We go home. If Menelaus kills Paris, the Trojans give back Helen and pay damages. If they refuse, I stay and fight till I get justice."

He cut the lambs' throats. They died. He poured wine into cups. He prayed again.

"Whoever breaks this oath, may their brains spill like this wine. May their wives become slaves."

The Trojans and Greeks both prayed.

Priam spoke. "I can't watch my son fight. I'm going back to the city."

He loaded the dead lambs onto his chariot. Drove back to Troy with Antenor.

Hector and Odysseus measured the ground. They cast lots from a bronze helmet. Who would throw first?

Helmet shaken. Paris' lot fell out first.

Both armies prayed. "Zeus, let the one who started this war die."

Paris put on his armor. Greaves. Cuirass (his brother Lycaon's). Sword. Shield. Helmet with horsehair crest. Spear.

Menelaus armed too.

They walked into the space between armies. Everyone watched. They were scared.

They stood near each other. Brandished spears. Furious.

Paris threw first. Hit Menelaus' shield. But the spear point turned. Didn't pierce.

Menelaus prayed. "Zeus, let me revenge myself on Paris. Let people learn not to wrong their hosts."

He threw his spear. It went through Paris' shield. Through his cuirass. Tore his shirt by his side.

Paris dodged. Saved his life.

Menelaus drew his sword. Swung at Paris' helmet. But the sword shattered. Pieces fell.

"Zeus!" Menelaus cried. "You're the worst god. My sword broke. My spear failed. I can't kill him."

He grabbed Paris' helmet. Caught the horsehair plume. Dragged him toward the Greek lines.

The chin strap choked Paris. Menelaus was winning.

But Aphrodite saw. She broke the leather strap. The helmet came off empty in Menelaus' hand.

He threw it to his comrades. Lunged again with his spear.

Aphrodite snatched Paris. Wrapped him in mist. Invisible.

She took him to his bedroom in Troy. Gently. Like death.

Helen was on the city wall. Still watching with Priam and the old men.

Aphrodite went to get her. She looked like an old servant. The one who used to dress wool for Helen in Sparta.

"Come," Aphrodite said. "Paris is waiting. He's in bed. Looks gorgeous. Like he's going to a dance."

Helen was angry. She recognized the goddess by her beautiful neck. Her sparkling eyes.

"Goddess," she said. "Why trick me? Menelaus just beat Paris. He's taking me back. You're trying to betray me."

"Don't provoke me," Aphrodite warned. "I'll make you hate me. I'll make Trojans and Greeks hate you. You'll come to a bad end."

Helen was scared. She followed the goddess. Silently. Invisible to the Trojan women.

They reached Paris' house. Servants were working. Helen went to her room. Aphrodite brought a chair for her. Set it facing Paris.

Helen sat down. Looked at him sideways. She was furious.

"So you're back from fighting?" she said. "I wish you'd died. You used to brag you'd beat Menelaus. Go challenge him again. But you won't. You'll die by his spear."

Paris answered. "Don't be mad. Menelaus beat me with Athena's help. But I'll beat him next time. Let's go to bed. I've never wanted you more."

Helen was torn. Her heart desired both home and Paris.

She got into bed with him.

Meanwhile, the Greeks were confused. They looked for Paris. Couldn't find him.

Agamemnon declared: "Paris ran away. Menelaus won. Give us Helen and pay damages."

The Greeks cheered.

**End of Book III**

# BOOK IV

The gods watched from Olympus.

Zeus turned to Hera. "Menelaus won. Should we stop this? Let them make peace?"

Hera was heated. "Hell no. Destroy Troy. All of it."

Zeus warned her. "Fine. But later, when I want to wreck a city you love, don't complain."

"Deal," Hera said. "Send Athena."

Athena dropped down. Found Pandarus. Trojan archer.

"You've got skills," she said. "Shoot Menelaus. Get famous."

"But we swore a truce," Pandarus said.

"Don't worry about it," Athena lied. "Just one shot."

She guided his aim.

Pandarus shot. The arrow flew. Hit Menelaus in the belt. Right where the armor joined.

But Athena deflected it. Just enough to wound, not kill.

The arrow pierced the belt. Drew blood.

Menelaus looked down. Saw red.

Agamemnon grabbed his hand. "You're hit."

"I'm good," Menelaus said. "Just a scratch."

Agamemnon wasn't hearing it. "Machaon! Fix him!"

Machaon ran up. Son of the healing god. He pulled the arrow. Cut the belt. Sucked the blood. Applied herbs.

While Menelaus got patched, Agamemnon walked the lines. Rallying his soldiers.

He found Odysseus. "You bailing?"

Odysseus snapped back. "I'm right here."

"Prove it," Agamemnon said.

He found Diomedes. "Your father would be ashamed."

Diomedes burned. But stayed silent.

Agamemnon kept moving. Waking the troops.

The Trojans formed up too.

Both sides charged.

They met in the middle. Shields crashed. Spears stabbed.

War was back on.

**End of Book IV**

# BOOK V

Athena gave Diomedes strength. Straight-up superpowers. She told him to fight.

Diomedes went ham. He killed everyone in his path. Trojans dropped like flies.

He hit Agelaus' horse. The spear went through. Horse reared. Agelaus fell. Diomedes gutted him.

He killed Archelochus. Killed Chromius. Killed Abas.

His charioteer Sthenelus collected armor.

Aeneas saw the carnage. He looked for Pandarus.

"We need to stop this guy," Aeneas said.

Pandarus grabbed his bow. He was a great archer.

"One shot," Pandarus said. "I'll take him down."

He shot. The arrow flew. Hit Diomedes in the shoulder. On the armor joint. Blood flowed.

Diomedes stumbled.

"Still alive?" Sthenelus asked.

"Just a flesh wound," Diomedes said.

He prayed to Athena. "Help me."

Athena heard. "You're good now. No fear. Go kill Aeneas."

Diomedes moved forward. Sthenelus drove.

Aeneas saw him coming. He grabbed a rock. Heavy. Could crush two men.

But Diomedes threw first. His spear hit Aeneas' hip. Went through. Broke the bone.

Aeneas collapsed.

Pandarus saw his chance. He threw his spear at Diomedes. Missed. Hit a Greek instead.

Diomedes threw back. Hit Pandarus. Right through the nose. Knocked out his teeth. Went into his brain. Pandarus died.

Aphrodite saw Aeneas bleeding. He was her son. She swooped down. Wrapped him in her cloak.

Diomedes knew she was a god. But he didn't care. He charged her.

He stabbed her hand. The spear went through her wrist. Divine blood flowed.

Aphrodite screamed. Dropped Aeneas. Fled to Olympus.

Apollo caught Aeneas. Covered him in mist. Healed him.

"Stay out of this," Apollo said. "You're not built for god-fighting."

Ares was watching. Mars. God of war.

"Let's go," he called to the Trojans. "Push these Greeks back."

He joined the fight. In human form.

Athena saw this. She found Diomedes again.

"See that guy? That's Ares. Wound him."

"Last time I stabbed a god," Diomedes said, "you said don't."

"Different now," Athena said. "Go."

She helped him. Gave him a boost. Diomedes charged Ares blindly.

He threw his spear. Athena guided it.

The spear hit Ares in the gut. Divine ichor poured out.

Ares bellowed like nine thousand men. He went back to Olympus.

Zeus saw him coming. "What happened?"

"Athena made Diomedes stab me!" Ares complained.

Zeus was disgusted. "You're a coward. You whine like a baby. I hate you."

Meanwhile, fighting continued.

Hector rallied his troops. He was everywhere.

Sarpedon spoke to him. "Where's your fire? You're supposed to lead."

"You're right," Hector said.

They fought harder.

The day wore on. Both sides took losses.

The sun set. Night came. Darkness ended the battle.

The Greeks returned to their ships. The Trojans to their city.

Both sides counted their dead. Burned them.

Tomorrow would bring more blood.

**End of Book V**

# BOOK VI

The battle kept raging.

Glaucus charged at Diomedes. Diomedes saw him coming. Threw his spear.

It missed. Over Glaucus' shoulder.

"Who are you?" Diomedes shouted. "Never seen you before. Gods must've sent you. But I'll test you."

Glaucus answered. "Why ask my story? Like leaves, human generations fall. But if you want to know—I'm from Argos. My grandfather was Oeneus. He hosted Bellerophon. They exchanged gifts. Family friends."

Diomedes paused. He planted his spear in the ground. Stepped closer.

"You're my grandfather's people's friend? Oeneus was my granddad's man too. We're guest-friends. I can't fight you."

They clasped hands. Swapped armor. Glaucus gave gold armor worth nine oxen. Diomedes gave bronze worth eight.

Both sides saw this. Troops murmured.

Meanwhile, Hector got a message. His mother Hecuba sent for him. He left the battle. Went back to Troy.

In the city, women crowded around him. They were terrified. He told them to pray to Athena. Bring her gifts.

His mom met him at the palace. She was old but fierce.

"Son," she said. "Come in. Have wine. Rest."

"No time," Hector said. "I need to send the women to Athena. Then find Paris. Then get back to battle. I can feel the Greeks winning."

He found Paris. In his bedroom with Helen. Fine clothes laid out. Polishing his armor. Acting casual.

Hector was disgusted. "Paris! People are dying. You started this. Get your gear. Get out there."

Paris was embarrassed. "You're right. I was just... preparing. My wife was encouraging me."

Helen looked ashamed.

"Let him fight or not," Hector said. "I don't care anymore. I'm going."

He left. His heart heavy. He went to find his own wife, Andromache.

She wasn't home. A servant told him she'd gone to the city wall. She heard the Greeks were winning. She was scared.

Hector ran through the streets. He reached the wall.

Andromache was there. Their baby son, Astyanax, with her. A nurse held him.

When she saw Hector, she cried and ran to him.

"Husband," she said. "Your courage will kill you. You're my everything. My father, my mother, my husband. Troy can't hold out. The Greeks are too strong. Stay here. On the wall. Don't go back."

She held their baby out. "Think of him. He'll be an orphan. A widow's son. Everyone will pity him."

Hector looked at his son. Reached for him.

The baby saw the bronze helmet. The horsehair crest. He screamed. Terrified.

Hector laughed. Took off the helmet. Set it on the ground.

He picked up his son. Kissed him. Prayed aloud.

"Zeus, let this boy be greater than me. Let him rule stronger. Let people say 'his father was better.' But at least he had a father who fought."

He gave the baby back to Andromache. She took him, smiling and crying at once.

Hector put his helmet back on. Andromache held his hand.

"Come back," she whispered.

"I will," he lied.

He knew he wouldn't.

He walked away. Didn't look back.

Paris caught up with him in the courtyard. His armor shining.

"Brother, wait. I'm coming. Let's fight together."

Hector barely looked at him. "Let's go."

They left the city. Side by side. Both knowing what waited.

**End of Book VI**

# BOOK VII

Hector stood between the armies.

"Pick your best fighter," he yelled at the Greeks. "Let him face me. Winner takes all. Let's settle this like men."

The Greeks were silent. No one moved.

Hector laughed. "Scared? I knew it."

Menelaus burned. He started forward. "I'll end this—"

But Agamemnon grabbed him. "Sit down. You're not fighting Hector. You're too valuable."

Nestor stood up. Old but still fierce. He shamed the younger men.

"Nine years ago you bragged you'd take Troy. Now one man challenges you and you freeze? Where's your pride?"

Nine Greek heroes jumped up. Agamemnon. Diomedes. Ajax. Idomeneus. All of them wanted the fight.

Nestor said. "Draw lots. Let chance pick."

They marked sticks. Put them in a helmet. Shook it. Nestor pulled one.

Ajax the Great. His stick.

"Yes!" Ajax shouted. "I wanted this. I'll beat Hector."

The Greeks were hyped.

Ajax armed up. Heavy armor. Seven-layered shield. Huge spear.

Hector waited. Not worried.

They met in the middle. Threw spears. Both hit shields. Didn't penetrate.

They fought with swords. Hacked at each other's shields. The noise was deafening.

They were like lions. Or wild boars.

Ajax's shield took most hits. The layers peeled off like onion skins.

Hector's shield bent. His neck was bruised.

They kept swinging.

It was almost dark. Heralds came out. One from each side.

"Stop," they said. "The day is done. The gods love you both. You're both brave. Stop fighting. Night is here."

Ajax answered. "Only if Hector says stop. I came for him."

Hector said. "Ajax, you're big. Strong. Skilled. We should stop. The day's over. We'll fight again later. Here's my sword. Take it."

He gave Ajax his sword with scabbard and belt.

Ajax gave Hector his purple belt.

They parted. Respecting each other.

The next morning, the Greeks had a wild idea.

Nestor stood in council. "We need to build a wall. Around our ships. A ditch too. With stakes. Protect ourselves."

The others agreed. They got to work.

Thousands dug. Thousands carried stones.

The wall rose. With towers. Gates. Everything.

They didn't sacrifice to the gods first.

This pissed off Poseidon. He complained to Zeus.

"Father," he said. "These Greeks built a wall without offering. Their fame will last. People will forget the wall I built. Me and Apollo. For Laomedon. First king of Troy."

Zeus answered. "When they leave, destroy their wall. Scatter it into the sea. Cover the beach with sand again. Let our wall be remembered."

Meanwhile, the Trojans met in council.

Antenor spoke. "We should give Helen back. With all her stuff. We made an oath. Let's honor it."

Paris refused. "No. But I'll give back her wealth. Add more from my own. That should satisfy them."

Priam made the final call. "We'll give back the wealth. But keep Helen. Send a messenger to the Greeks. Offer the treasure."

They chose messengers. Idaios and others.

The messengers went to the Greek camp.

They found the leaders. Offered Paris' terms.

The leaders were silent. Eventually Diomedes spoke.

"No deal. We see what's happening. You keep the woman. You offer goods. We came for blood. We're taking Troy."

Idaios left. Took the message back.

The Trojans prepared for siege.

The Greeks strengthened their wall.

Both sides waited.

War would come again.

**End of Book VII**

# BOOK VIII

Zeus laid down the law.

"Listen up, gods," he said. "No interfering today. Stay put. Let the mortals fight it out."

He grabbed his golden scales. Put the fates of Greeks and Trojans on each side.

The Greek side sank. Heavy. Doom.

Zeus thundered from Ida. Lightning flashed.

The Greeks froze. Terror spread.

Trojans charged hard. Hector led the rush.

He was like a whirlwind. Spear in hand. Shouting orders.

Diomedes saw him coming. Threw a spear. Missed.

Hector threw back. Hit Diomedes' shield. The impact bent the bronze. Crushed the shoulder strap.

Diomedes fell back.

Nestor dragged him to safety. His horses carried them both.

Hector chased. Shouting. "See that? Zeus is with us! Keep pushing!"

They pushed hard. Greeks retreated.

Agamemnon watched. Panic rose.

"Nestor," he said. "Go to Achilles. Beg him. Offer anything. Treasure. Women. Even his ships back if we survive."

Nestor went. He found Achilles and Patroclus. Sang a sad song. About old warriors.

Achilles listened. Then cut him off.

"Not happening. Agamemnon dishonored me. Has to pay the price."

Nestor left empty-handed.

Back at the battle, things got worse.

Hector was unstoppable. He reached the ships.

Zeus watched from Ida. Sent a message.

"Pull back, Trojans. Dark is coming. Night ends battle. Tomorrow, we'll finish this."

Hector obeyed. He pulled his troops back.

They camped on the plain. Right by the Greek wall.

They lit fires. Hundreds of them. It looked like stars fallen to earth.

The Greeks were penned in. No way out.

Trapped at their ships.

**End of Book VIII**

# BOOK IX

Greek leaders met in crisis.

Their camp was on fire. Trojans had them cornered at the ships. Morale was dead.

Agamemnon spoke first. "We're screwed. I messed up. Nine years wasted. Zeus lied. We can't win without Achilles."

He looked around. "Send him gifts. Give back Briseis. Add treasure. Lots of it. His own ship when we leave. My daughter in marriage. Seven cities. Anything."

The others agreed. They picked three envoys.

Odysseus. Ajax. Phoenix.

They walked to Achilles' tent. Found him playing the lyre. Patroclus listened beside him.

They sat down. Achilles offered food. Wine.

Odysseus spoke first. "Brother. The Greeks are dying. Hector's at the ships. We need you. Agamemnon admits he was wrong. Look at these gifts."

He listed them all. Briseis returned. Twenty Trojan women. Seven tripods. Ten gold talents. Twenty cauldrons. Twelve horses. Seven cities. One of Agamemnon's three daughters. A ship full of treasure.

"Come back," Odysseus finished. "Your pride will be restored."

Achilles was still. Then he spoke.

"Odysseus. I appreciate the visit. But save your breath. Agamemnon can't buy me. My life is short. My glory was stolen. He took my prize. Dishonored me in front of everyone."

He continued.

"My mother told me two fates. Stay here, die young, get eternal glory. Or go home, live long, die forgotten. I choose home. Tomorrow I sail. You're welcome to join me."

He looked at each man.

"Tell Agamemnon this: Gifts mean nothing. Honor is everything."

Phoenix was crying. Old friend of Achilles' dad. He raised Achilles from a boy.

"Akhi, remember me. Your father sent me to teach you. To be a speaker of words and a doer of deeds."

He told a story.

"Once there was a man named Meleager. He got angry. Refused to fight. His city was under siege. They offered him gifts. He refused. But when his wife begged him, he fought. Got nothing. No gifts. No honor. Don't be like that. Take the gifts. Fight now."

Achilles heard him out. Then answered.

"Phoenix. I respect you. Sleep here tonight. We'll decide tomorrow. But my mind is set. Honor matters more than gold."

Ajax stood up. He hadn't spoken. He looked at Odysseus.

"Let's go. This is useless. His heart is stone."

They left. Walked back in silence.

They reported to Agamemnon. He listened. Head down. Defeated.

"So be it," he said. "We'll fight without him."

The council broke up. Men went to their tents.

But sleep wouldn't come. They knew tomorrow would be worse.

**End of Book IX**

# BOOK X

Agamemnon couldn't sleep. Too stressed.

He got up. Put on his armor. Grabbed his spear. Went to find Nestor.

"Can't rest," he said. "Trojans are too close."

Nestor agreed. "Let's wake the others."

They went around. Woke Odysseus. Diomedes. Ajax. Everyone.

The leaders met. Standing in the dark.

"What now?" Nestor asked.

"Someone needs to spy," Diomedes said. "I'll go. Need one man with me."

Odysseus stepped up. "I'm your guy."

They prayed to Athena. Then left.

They walked through the dark. Toward the Trojan camp.

They spotted a man. Coming toward them. Trojan scout. Name was Dolon.

Odysseus grabbed him. Diomedes held a sword to his throat.

"Talk," Diomedus said. "Or die."

Dolon blabbed everything. Trojan positions. Rhesus' new horse herd. Everything.

"Please," Dolon begged. "Let me go. I'll give you ransom."

Diomedes didn't care. He killed him. Took his gear.

They went to Rhesus' camp. Found the horses. Best horses ever.

They killed the guards. Twelve Thracians. In their sleep.

They found Rhesus. Sleeping. Diomedes stabbed him through the heart. Blood everywhere.

Odysseus untied the horses. Led them away.

Diomedes grabbed more gear. They headed back.

Apollo saw them. Woke the Trojans with a scream.

They ran.

The Greeks at camp saw them coming. Opened the gates.

They brought in the horses. Showed off the loot.

The other Greeks were amazed. Jealous. Inspired.

They ate. Celebrated.

Tomorrow, they'd fight again.

**End of Book X**

# BOOK XI

Dawn came up. Zeus sent down Strife. She planted herself by the Greek ships.

Both sides geared up. Wanted blood.

Agamemnon put on his armor. Bronze that shined like fire. Ten black rings of blue enamel. Gold snake heads at the clasp. Silver studs. Ten rows of blue enamel. Bosses of twenty.

He grabbed his spear. Silver-bladed. Sharp as hell.

He moved out. Looked like a god. Men followed.

The Trojans saw him coming. They ran.

He killed Bienor first. Stabbed through the chest. Killed his friend Oileus next. Killed Isus and Antiphus. Priam's sons. Caught them in their chariot. Speared them both. Killed Hippolochus. Cut off his hands and head. Sent his body rolling like a log.

He ran wild. Killed seven more. Then seven more. The field ran red.

Hector watched. He stayed back. Waiting. He knew Zeus had promised: Agamemnon would get wounded. Then Hector could attack.

Sure enough, Coön saw his brother dying. He speared Agamemnon's arm. Below the elbow.

Agamemnon felt it. He killed Coön. But the blood flowed. Pain hit.

He got in his chariot. Drove back to the ships.

Hector saw him leave. He yelled. "Zeus is with us! Attack!"

He charged. Killed nine Greeks. Then nine more. Then nine more.

Diomedes saw the carnage. He met Hector head-on. Spear to spear.

Zeus made Diomedes' spear miss. But Hector's found its mark. Hit Diomedes' chest. The armor took it. Saved his life.

Diomedes threw again. Hit Hector's helmet. Glanced off.

Hector got dizzy. Fell back. His men dragged him away.

Paris saw an opening. Shot Diomedes in the foot. The arrow sunk deep.

Diomedes limped away. Leaned on his spear.

"You're done," Odysseus said.

"Not done," Diomedes said. "But you're right. I'm out."

He left.

Odysseus stood alone. Surrounded by Trojans. He fought like a boar. Killed five. Then ten. Then fifteen.

Socus saw him. "Brothers! Surround him!"

He threw his spear. Hit Odysseus' ribs. Cracked the armor. Drew blood.

Odysseus staggered. But he threw back. His spear went through Socus' shield. Through his chest. Out the back. Socus died.

Odysseus tried to pull the spear out. Couldn't. The Trojans closed in.

He called for help. Greek friends heard. Came running.

Ajax got there first. He was a moving fortress. Shield like a wall. He stood over Odysseus. Protected him.

A Trojan doctor came. Pulled the spear out. Patched the wound.

Odysseus went back to the ships.

Ajax held the line alone. Killed Trojans. But they kept coming.

Machaon fought near him. Archery expert. But Paris shot him in the shoulder. The arrow went deep.

Machaon left the field. He was a healer. Now he needed healing himself.

Achilles stood by his ships. He saw Machaon passing. He told Patroclus.

"Find out who that is. If it's Machaon, we need him alive."

Patroclus ran. He met Nestor first. Nestor was hauling a wounded man. Eurypylus.

"Patroclus," Nestor said. "Look at this mess. Diomedes wounded. Odysseus wounded. Machaon wounded. We're losing."

He went on and on. Old man venting.

"Go to Achilles. Beg him. If he won't fight, ask for his armor. Put it on. Lead the Myrmidons. Maybe the Trojans will think it's him. Maybe that'll scare them."

Patroclus listened. Healed Eurypylus' wound. Gave him herbs. Helped him to his tent.

Then he walked back slowly. Thinking.

The words hit him hard.

**End of Book XI**

# BOOK XII

The Trojans wanted those ships.

They'd camped all night. Fires burning. Now they saw the Greek wall. New-built. But strong.

Hector made a plan. "Ignore the gates," he said. "We'll go at the wall direct. Overwhelm them."

Sarpedon spoke to Glaucus. "Bro. We're kings. We live good. We eat well. Our people look up to us. Now we gotta prove we deserve it. If we hang back, we're cowards. Let's lead the charge."

Glaucus agreed.

They headed for a section where the wall was weakest. Ajax and Teucer defended it.

The Trojans came with shields locked. Like a turtle shell. Underneath, they carried a massive beam. To ram the wall.

The Greeks saw them coming. They threw rocks. Heavy ones. They rained down.

Trojans died. The beam dropped.

Sarpedon grabbed it. "Pick it up!" he yelled. "Now!"

They lifted it. Ran at the wall. Smash.

The wall shook. But held.

Greek archers fired. Arrows found necks. Chests. Faces.

Sarpedon fell. Wounded. Glaucus too.

Hector saw his best men drop. He ran to the gates. Grabbed a boulder. Massive. No normal man could lift it.

But Hector was no normal man. He hoisted it. Ran.

He slammed it into the gates. The wood splintered. The hinges screamed. The gates burst open.

"GO!" Hector roared.

Trojans poured through. Like flood water. Like a broken dam.

The Greeks at the wall ran for their ships. They'd held all day. But now? The wall was breached.

The Trojans chased. Killing as they went.

Night fell. But the Trojans stayed close. Right at the wall. They lit more fires. Hundreds.

The Greeks were trapped. Their ships were surrounded.

Tomorrow would decide everything.

**End of Book XII**

# BOOK XIII

Zeus looked away for a second.

He turned his head toward the Thracian horsemen. Something caught his eye. The battle noise faded for him.

Poseidon saw his chance.

He'd been waiting. Stuck on the sidelines. Zeus said no interfering. But now? Now the big man wasn't looking.

Poseidon dropped down from Olympus. He moved like mist. He found the Greek lines.

"LISTEN UP!" he roared. But only Greeks could hear him. Trojan ears were deaf.

He sounded like Thoas, the Aetolian chief. A respected voice.

"Where's your pride?" he shouted. "You're warriors. Not sheep. Push back!"

The Greeks heard him. Their spines straightened. Their jaws set.

They pushed.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the field, Idomeneus was going off.

The Cretan king was old but still deadly. He saw a gap in the Trojan line. He charged through it.

He killed Othryoneus first. The Trojan was bragging about marrying Cassandra. Idomeneus' spear went through his chest. Killed him mid-boast.

Then he killed Asius. Then Alcathous. Then twenty more.

His armor was painted red. Not with paint.

Aeneas saw the slaughter. He looked for Hector. Couldn't find him. Hector was busy elsewhere.

So Aeneas rallied the Trojans himself. "Stand!" he yelled. "Hold the line!"

He found Paris. "We need your bow. Hector wants you."

Paris was chilling. "My bow's broken. I'm fixing it."

Fixing it? In the middle of battle?

Aeneas was disgusted. He left Paris. Found Deiphobus instead.

"Let's go," he said.

They charged Idomeneus.

The old Cretan saw them coming. He didn't flinch. He threw. His spear hit Deiphobus' shield. It went through.

Deiphobus fell. Wounded.

Helenus ran up. He was a prophet. Also a fighter. He threw his spear at Idomeneus. Missed.

Idomeneus threw back. Hit Helenus' hand. Broke it. The spear flew loose.

Trojans were dropping. The Greek push was working.

Poseidon was everywhere. Cheering them on.

"Break them!" he yelled. "Drive them to their city!"

Hector finally reappeared. He'd been organizing the far flank. He saw his center collapsing.

He tried to rally. But his voice was lost in the noise. Too much chaos.

He found Aeneas. "We need to hold."

But the Greeks were coming in waves. Fresh men. Inspired by the sea god's words.

Hector fought like a demon. Killed ten Greeks. Then ten more. But for every one he killed, two more appeared.

He was pushing forward when a spear caught him in the chest.

His armor held. But the impact knocked him back. He stumbled.

Apollo saw. The god intervened. He shielded Hector with mist. Pulled him back to safety.

Without Hector, the Trojans broke completely.

They ran. Full retreat.

The Greeks chased them all the way to the Trojan wall.

They stood outside, cheering.

Inside the city, Priam saw the rout. He ordered the gates opened. Trojans poured in.

The gates slammed shut.

The Greeks camped outside.

They'd won the day. But the war wasn't over.

Not even close.

**End of Book XIII**

# BOOK XIV

Nestor wasn't feeling it.

He watched the battle from his chariot. The Greeks were holding. But barely. His stomach churned.

Agamemnon was still wounded. So was Odysseus. So was Diomedes. They'd left the field.

Nestor found them sitting by the ships. Looking depressed.

"Get up," Nestor said. "We need to check the lines. Show our faces."

They got up. Slowly. Painfully. They walked to the edge. Watched the fighting.

Agamemnon's eyes watered. "We're finished."

"Shut up," Odysseus snapped. "We're not finished."

Meanwhile, on Olympus, Hera was scheming.

She saw Zeus wasn't watching the battle. He was focused on other stuff. She had an idea.

She went to find Aphrodite.

"Sis," Hera said sweetly. "I need your magic girdle. The one that makes men crazy. I'm going to see Oceanus and Tethys. Work out some drama."

Aphrodite bought it. She gave Hera the girdle. It had love, desire, sweet talk, all woven in.

Hera took it. Put it on.

Then she went to find Sleep. Hypnos.

"Hey," she said. "Remember that time you put Zeus to sleep? I asked you to? When Heracles was sailing home? And Zeus was gonna wreck his ship? You did me solid."

"Yeah," Sleep said. "And Zeus almost threw me into the sea. I'm not doing that again."

Hera pulled out the big guns. "Name your price."

"Pasithea," Sleep said. "The youngest Grace. I want to marry her."

"Done," Hera said. "Now come with me."

They flew to Ida. Zeus sat on the peak. Watching everything.

Zeus saw Hera coming. He knew her tricks. "What are you doing here?" he asked. "More complaints about Troy?"

Hera played innocent. "No, no. Just wanted to see you. You're so strong. So wise."

Zeus felt the girdle's power. He was done. Overwhelmed.

"Let's go to bed," he said.

They found a golden cloud. No one could see through it.

Zeus held Hera. He told her everything. His whole plan for Troy. The future. The details.

Then he passed out. Deep sleep.

Sleep floated down. Touched Zeus' eyes. Sealed them shut.

Poseidon felt it immediately. Zeus' attention was gone.

He dropped into the battle. Roared at the Greeks.

"THIS IS YOUR CHANCE! PUSH!"

The Greeks heard. They felt it in their bones.

They pushed. Hard.

Ajax led the charge. He found Hector. They'd dueled before. Respected each other. Not today.

Ajax picked up a rock. Huge. No man could lift it. But Ajax could.

He hurled it.

The rock hit Hector in the chest. Knocked him flat. He bounced. Landed hard. Spear flew from his hand.

His armor saved his life. But he was out cold. Couldn't breathe.

The Trojans saw their leader fall. Panic spread.

They grabbed Hector. Carried him back to Troy. His heels dragged in the dirt.

The Greeks surged forward. They reached the Trojan walls again. Cheered.

Inside Troy, Hector woke up. Gasping. He vomited blood.

Doctors worked on him. Gave him herbs. He'd live. But he was done for the day.

The Trojans on the wall watched the Greeks celebrate.

Night came. Both sides slept.

But Zeus was still out. Still sleeping.

Poseidon worked through the night. Strengthening Greek positions.

Tomorrow? Different story.

**End of Book XIV**

# BOOK XV

Zeus woke up.

He was pissed.

He looked down at the battlefield. Saw the Greeks winning. Knew he'd been played.

He turned on Hera. "You witch. You seduced me. You drugged me. You're trying to save the Greeks."

Hera panicked. "Wasn't me! Poseidon did it. I just... went along."

Zeus stared at her. "You lie. But I'm done. I'm taking control back."

He called Iris. "Find Poseidon. Tell him to stop. Right now. Or we fight."

Iris flew fast. Found Poseidon. Delivered the message.

Poseidon was furious. "Who does Zeus think he is? We're equals. We drew lots. I got the sea. He got the sky. I don't answer to him."

Iris warned. "Don't do this. Zeus will wreck you. His thunderbolt is no joke."

Poseidon backed down. "Okay. But I'm telling you, this is wrong. The Greeks are doomed now."

He left the battlefield. Went back to the sea. Fuming.

Zeus called Apollo. "Go to Hector. Wake him up. Heal him completely. Then push the Greeks back. Drive them to their ships."

Apollo flew down. Found Hector still recovering. He breathed life into him.

Hector jumped up. Fresh. Stronger than before. Like a horse breaking free from chains.

He ran back to the battle. "TROJANS! TO ME!"

They saw him. Cheered. Their spirits soared.

They attacked. Harder than ever.

The Greeks saw Hector return. Fresh as dawn. Their hearts sank.

He killed eight. Then eight more. Then eight more.

Agamemnon watched. He yelled.

"Stand! Fight! Don't run!"

But they ran anyway.

The Trojans pushed them. Back. Further back.

All the way to the ships.

Great Ajax stood alone. Between the Trojans and the fleet.

He was a wall. A one-man army.

Hector found him.

"Move."

"No."

They fought. Spears clashed. Shields cracked.

Zeus watched. He favored Hector. He made Ajax's spear miss. But Hector's found Ajax's chest.

The armor held. Ajax was stunned but alive.

He grabbed a rock. Pounded Hector's shield. It bent like tin.

Hector's knees buckled.

A Trojan friend dragged him away. Covered him.

They retreated a bit. Regrouped.

But they had the Greeks where Zeus wanted them. At the ships. Trapped.

Night was coming. But tomorrow?

Tomorrow the ships would burn.

**End of Book XV**

# BOOK XVI

Patroclus couldn't take it anymore.

He watched from the ships. Saw the Trojans pressing. Saw the Greeks dying. His heart broke.

He found Achilles in his tent. Still sulking.

"Bro," Patroclus said. "Enough. Your pride is killing our people. If you won't fight, let me. Give me your armor. Let me lead the Myrmidons. The Trojans will think it's you. Might scare them back."

Achilles paused. He looked at his friend. Saw the pain.

"Fine," he said slowly. "But listen. Drive them from the ships. That's it. Don't chase them to Troy. Don't fight Hector. He's mine. And come back safe."

"I hear you," Patroclus said.

Achilles called his troops. The Myrmidons. Fifty ships of them. He gave orders.

"My friend Patroclus leads. Obey him like you'd obey me."

He gave Patroclus his armor. Divine armor. Made by Hephaestus. Impossible to mistake.

Patroclus put it on. He looked like Achilles. Moved like him. Sounded like him.

The Myrmidons formed up. Ready.

Patroclus marched them out.

The Trojans saw. They froze.

"ACHILLES!" someone screamed.

Panic spread. They bolted.

Patroclus charged. Cut them down. Killed twenty. Then twenty more. Then twenty more.

He reached Sarpedon. Lycian king. Zeus's own son. They fought.

Sarpedon threw. Missed.

Patroclus threw. Hit him square in the chest. Sarpedon fell. Died.

Zeus watched from Ida. Saw his son die. He wept tears of blood.

"Do I save him?" he asked Hera.

"You're the king," she said. "But if you save him, other gods will want their favorites saved. War will never end. Let him go."

Zeus wept. But he let Sarpedon die.

The Trojans kept running. All the way to their wall.

Patroclus chased. He forgot Achilles' warning.

He reached the wall. Started climbing.

Apollo appeared.

"Stop," the god commanded. "The city is not for you. You are not Achilles."

Patroclus ignored him. Kept climbing.

Apollo shoved him. Hard. Knocked him down three times.

The fourth time, Hector saw his opening.

He charged. His spear caught Patroclus in the back. Between the shoulder blades.

Patroclus fell. Hard.

He gasped for air. Blood filled his lungs.

Hector stood over him.

"Thought you were Achilles," Hector said. "You're not."

Patroclus coughed. "Wasn't my idea. Apollo knocked me down. You just finished me."

Hector pulled the spear out. Finished him off.

Then he stripped the armor. Divine armor. Put it on himself.

The Trojans cheered. They'd beaten "Achilles."

But the Myrmidons saw Patroclus' body. They screamed. Rage took over.

They fought to retrieve the corpse. Fought like demons.

Back at the ships, Achilles heard the scream.

He ran out. Saw the retreat. Saw the body being carried back.

"No," he whispered.

Then louder. "NO!"

He ran to the body. Took it in his arms.

"Patroclus," he cried. "I failed you."

His tears fell on the dead face.

Around him, the Myrmidons stood silent. The Greeks gathered.

The war had just changed.

**End of Book XVI**

# BOOK XVII

The Trojans wanted that corpse.

Hector was already wearing the armor. But the body? That was a trophy.

Menelaus saw the danger. He stood over Patroclus. Shield up. Alone.

Euphorbus came first. Young. Fast. Confident. He threw.

Menelaus dodged. Stabbed back. Spear through the throat. Euphorbus dropped.

But more Trojans came. Menelaus was outnumbered.

He yelled. "AJAX!"

Ajax heard. He was already running. Huge. Fast.

He crashed into the Trojans like a wave. Killed two. Four. Six.

They fell back.

Meanwhile, Glaucus found Hector.

"Nice armor," Glaucus said. "But you let Patroclus kill Sarpedon. Then you let the Greeks take his body. You ran. Now you're after scraps? That's not leadership."

Hector felt the sting. He rallied his men. "Back to the fight!"

They returned. Hard.

The Greeks saw them coming. They formed a ring around the body. Menelaus. Ajax. Meriones. All the best.

Zeus watched. He pulled out his scales. Put the fates of both sides on it.

The Greek side sank. Heavy.

Apollo moved unseen. He breathed strength into Hector. Made him faster. Stronger.

Hector hit Ajax with a rock. Big one. Ajax's shield cracked. Seven layers broke.

Ajax stumbled. But he threw back. A rock the size of a millstone. Hit Hector's shield. The shield caved. Hector fell back.

Menelaus and Meriones grabbed Patroclus' body. Started dragging it toward the ships.

The fight became a tug-of-war. Greeks pulled. Trojans pulled. The body was in the middle.

Achilles watched from his ship. He saw it all. Boiled inside.

Zeus saw Achilles' rage building. He sent Iris.

"Go," Zeus said. "Tell him to show himself. That'll scare the Trojans long enough to get the body back. But he can't fight yet."

Iris flashed down.

"Akhi," she said. "Show yourself. No armor. Just appear. The Trojans will panic. Buy time."

Achilles walked to the trench. No armor. Just himself.

He shouted. A roar that came from grief and rage.

The Trojans heard. They saw him. Even unarmed. They froze.

"Achilles," someone whispered.

Then louder. "ACHILLES IS BACK!"

Panic spread like fire. They ran.

The Greeks got Patroclus' body clear. Carried it to the ships.

Achilles stood there. Watching. Tears streaming down his face.

Tomorrow, he'd wear armor again.

But not his own. Someone else's.

**End of Book XVII**

# BOOK XVIII

Achilles was a mess.

He sat by Patroclus' body. Wouldn't leave. Held the cold hand. Rocked back and forth. Moaning.

Antilochus tried to comfort him. No use.

Achilles' mom heard him. Thetis rose from the sea. Silver-footed. She found her son.

"Child," she said. "What happened?"

"Patroclus is dead. Hector killed him. Took my armor. I'm going to kill Hector. Even if I die."

"You'll die if you fight," Thetis said. "Your fate is sealed."

"I know. Let me die."

Thetis knew better than to argue. "You need armor. New armor. I'll get it."

She flew to Olympus. Straight to Hephaestus' forge.

The god of fire was working. His assistants were golden robots. They looked real. Moved real. Did the work.

Thetis walked in. "Hephaestus."

He saw her. Stopped his hammering.

"Thetis. What brings you here?"

"My son needs armor. His is lost. Hector took it."

Hephaestus grumbled. But he owed Thetis. She raised him when his mom threw him off Olympus.

"Fine. Give me time."

He threw bronze in the fire. Gold. Silver. Tin.

He worked the bellows. Twenty bellows. All at once. The fire roared.

He made a shield first. Not just any shield. A masterpiece.

He carved the whole world on it. Earth. Sky. Sea. Sun. Moon. Stars.

He carved two cities. One at peace. Weddings. Trials. Harvest.

One at war. Siege. Ambush. Battle.

He carved a field. Ploughmen. A king's estate.

He carved a vineyard. Gold vines. Silver leaves. Grapes onyx. Kids harvest.

He carved cattle. Lions attacking. Dogs fighting lions.

He carved sheep in a valley.

He carved dancers in a ring. Gold dresses. Silver jewelry. Crowds watching.

The shield was done. It weighed a ton. But only a demigod could lift it.

He made a helmet next. Bronze. Plume of gold.

Then greaves. Flexible. Strong.

Then a corselet. Glittering. Bronze scales.

Then a sword. Silver-studded hilt.

Then a spear. Heavy. Balanced. Perfect.

He packed it all. Gave it to Thetis.

"Give this to your son. It's the best I've ever made."

Thetis thanked him. Flew back down.

She found Achilles. Still grieving.

"Here," she said. "Armor of the gods."

Achilles looked at it. The shield caught his eye. The detail. The beauty. The world captured in bronze.

He took the armor. Put it on.

It fit perfectly. Like skin.

He picked up the spear. Felt the balance.

He walked out.

The Myrmidons saw him. They gasped. He looked like a god of war.

Word spread. "Achilles is back."

The Greeks who'd been fighting, exhausted, heard the whisper. They straightened up. Looked over.

There he was. Shining. Terrible. Beautiful.

They cheered.

Across the field, the Trojans saw too. They saw the armor. The same armor Hector had been wearing. But now on the man who owned it.

Their hearts stopped.

"That's... that's Achilles," someone said.

Hector stood on the wall. He saw. He knew.

Tomorrow, they'd meet.

Today, Achilles had one task.

He stood over Patroclus' body.

"Brother," he whispered. "I will avenge you. Your death will be answered with his."

As the sun set, the Greeks prepared.

Tomorrow, the war would end. One way or another.

**End of Book XVIII**

# BOOK XIX

Achilles was ready. Suited up. He called a meeting.

Agamemnon came. Slowly. Wounded. Embarrassed.

Achilles looked at him. "Let's end this beef. My friend's dead. That's what matters now."

Odysseus stood between them. "Good. Now about those gifts."

Agamemnon nodded. He listed everything again. Briseis. Twenty women. Seven tripods. Ten talents. Twenty cauldrons. Twelve horses. Seven cities. His own daughter. A ship full of gold.

Servants brought the goods. Piled them up. Impressive.

Then Briseis was led out. She saw Patroclus' body on the bier. She screamed. Ran to it. Fell on it.

"You were kind to me!" she wailed. "You said you'd make me Achilles' wife! Now you're dead!"

Achilles watched. His face stone.

"Take her back to my tent," he said.

She was led away, still crying.

Achilles turned to Agamemnon. "The gifts are fine. But they don't matter. Keep them. I fight for Patroclus. Period."

Agamemnon looked uncomfortable. "Eat first. Feast. Rest."

"No," Achilles said. "I won't eat. I won't drink. Not while my friend lies dead. Not while Hector breathes."

He started walking toward the battlefield.

Odysseus stopped him. "Bro. You need food. The army needs food. You can't fight on an empty stomach. Zeus himself knows this."

Achilles was stubborn. "I said no."

He kept walking.

Zeus saw this. He turned to Athena.

"Go. Put ambrosia in his chest. Give him strength. He can't fight without eating."

Athena flashed down. Invisible. She pressed ambrosia into Achilles' chest. Divine food. Instant energy.

Achilles felt it. A surge. He didn't know what it was. But his hunger vanished.

He walked faster.

He reached the Greek lines. Men saw him. They cheered.

He shouted. "FORM UP!"

The army moved. Fast. Disciplined. Inspired.

They lined up on the plain. Thousands of them.

Achilles stood out front. The new armor caught the sun. Blinding.

On the Trojan side, they panicked. Hector tried to calm them.

"Stand!" he yelled. "We can beat him!"

But his voice shook a little.

The Trojans formed up anyway. They had no choice.

Achilles mounted his chariot. Automedon held the reins.

His horses were divine. Xanthos. Balius. A third, Pedasus, mortal but fast.

Xanthos looked at Achilles. The horse spoke. Prophesied.

"We'll run fast today. We'll bring you back. But your hour is coming. Fate is fixed. You will die."

The Erinyes (the Furies) shut the horse up. Prophecy done.

Achilles wasn't fazed. He knew his fate. He'd accepted it.

He raised his spear.

"FOR PATROCLUS!" he roared.

The Greeks roared back.

They charged.

The Trojans braced.

The final clash began.

**End of Book XIX**

# BOOK XX

Olympus was having a meeting.

Zeus called the gods together. "Alright," he said. "Achilles is back. He's too much. Trojans can't handle him. Everyone can jump in now. No more sitting out."

Poseidon clapped. "Finally."

Athena nodded. "Let's go."

They piled down.

On the other side: Apollo. Artemis. Ares. The Trojan-friendly gods.

Poseidon found Apollo. "You and me, sun boy."

Hera grabbed Artemis by the hair. Slapped her. Artemis' bow fell. She ran crying to Zeus.

Ares charged Athena. She threw a rock. Hit his neck. He went down hard.

The gods were fighting. Divine WWE.

Meanwhile, Achilles was on a rampage.

He killed Iphition. Split his skull.

He killed Demoleon. Spear through the temple.

He killed Hippodamas. Stabbed him in the back as he ran.

Twenty more. Thirty. He lost count.

Then he saw Aeneas. Hector's cousin. Priam's nephew.

"You're next," Achilles said.

Aeneas threw his spear. Hit Achilles' shield. Did nothing.

Achilles threw back. Aeneas ducked. The spear went over.

They closed in. Sword to sword.

Poseidon watched. "Can't let Aeneas die. He's got a destiny. Future king."

Poseidon threw a mist. Pulled Aeneas out. Replaced him with a fake.

Achilles hit the fake. It vaporized.

He looked around. Aeneas was gone.

"Whatever," Achilles said.

He kept killing.

Trojans ran for the city gates. Hector was holding them open. Urging them in.

Achilles saw him. "Finally."

He charged.

Apollo appeared. Grabbed Hector. Wrapped him in mist. Invisible.

Achilles swung at empty air.

"Where'd he go?" he yelled.

The Trojans inside the walls screamed at Hector. "Don't fight him! You're our last hope!"

But Hector stayed put. Stood his ground. Outside the gates. Waiting.

Achilles turned away. Killed more Trojans.

He chased them. All the way to the river. Scamander.

The river god was pissed. "Stop! You're clogging my streams with bodies!"

Achilles ignored him. Kept killing. Tossed corpses in the water.

Scamander boiled. "ENOUGH!"

The water rose up. Took human form. Swung at Achilles.

A wave crashed down. Pushed Achilles down. Tried to drown him.

Achilles grabbed a tree branch. Held on. Gasped for air.

Poseidon saw. He jumped in. Calmed the water.

"Not yet," Poseidon told the river. "He dies later. By your waters, yeah. But not today."

Scamander backed off. But he was still angry.

The fighting raged on.

Achilles killed more. The count was past one hundred.

He was covered in blood. None of it his own.

The sun started setting. Red light on red armor.

Tomorrow, he and Hector would meet.

Today, he just killed.

**End of Book XX**

# BOOK XXI

The river was mad as hell.

Scamander rose up again. Full form. Water giant.

"ACHILLES!" he boomed. "You're choking me with corpses!"

Achilles smirked. "Make me."

The river attacked. Waves slammed down. Current grabbed his legs.

He couldn't move. Water was stronger.

He prayed. "Help! Any god who cares!"

Poseidon heard. He raced over. Grabbed his hand.

"Enough, river!" Poseidon commanded.

But Scamander was too far gone. He kept rising. Flooding.

Hera saw. She called Hephaestus. "Fire time."

Hephaestus loved this. He sent flames. Riverbanks caught. Trees burned. Grass smoked.

Scamander's water boiled. He screamed.

"HEPHAESTUS! STOP!"

"Back off," Hephaestus said. "Or I boil you dry."

Scamander backed down. Flowed normal.

Achilles nodded thanks. Kept killing.

Meanwhile, the gods went full WWE.

Athena dropped Ares. Spear through the shoulder. Ares ran crying to Olympus.

Hera boxed Artemis' ears. Artemis' bow fell. She fled.

Poseidon taunted Apollo. "Shoot me, coward."

Apollo stayed chill. "Not worth it."

Ares complained to Zeus. "She started it!"

Zeus laughed. "You're weak."

Back on earth, Achilles hunted.

He saw Lycaon. Priam's son. He'd captured him once. Sold him to slavery. The kid escaped. Came home.

Bad timing.

Lycaon dropped his weapons. Ran. Grabbed Achilles' knees. Begged.

"Spare me! I was your guest!"

Achilles looked down. "Everyone dies. Even Patroclus. Even me. You? You're just a boy."

He killed him. Tossed the body in the river.

More Trojans came. He killed them all.

The river clogged again. Scamander wanted revenge but feared fire.

Achilles chased survivors. They ran for the city gates.

Hector stood outside. Waiting. Watching his men die.

Achilles saw him. Locked eyes.

"Finally," Achilles said.

But Apollo was there. "Not yet," he whispered.

He wrapped Hector in darkness. Pulled him back.

Achilles swung at air. Cursed.

"Where'd he go?!"

The Trojans inside yelled. "Stay in! Don't fight him!"

Hector argued. "I have to!"

But his men pulled him through the gates. Slam.

The Trojans were safe. For now.

Achilles stood outside. Alone with the dead.

"Tomorrow," he promised.

The sun set red.

**End of Book XXI**

# BOOK XXII

Priam was on the wall. He saw Achilles coming. He saw Hector waiting.

"Son!" he screamed. "Come inside. Don't fight him. My other sons are dead. You're all I have. If you die, Troy dies."

He begged. He wept. He tore his robes.

Hecuba pleaded too. "Please. My son. Come in."

Hector looked up at them. He wanted to. But shame held him there.

He'd led his men to death. He couldn't hide now.

Achilles was getting closer. Fast.

Hector ran. Around the city walls. Full speed.

Achilles chased. Like a hawk after a dove.

They circled once. Twice. Three times.

Zeus watched. Weighed the fates. Hector's side sank. Doom.

Athena found Achilles. Only he could see her.

"Stop running," she said. "I'll help. I'll trick him."

She flew down. Found Hector. Disguised as Deiphobus. His brother.

"Hector!" she called. "Let's face him together."

Hector stopped running. Turned. "You're here. Good."

They faced Achilles.

"Two on one," Achilles sneered.

"I've got this," fake Deiphobus said.

Hector threw his spear. Hit Achilles' shield. Dead center. The shield caught it. It stuck.

Achilles charged. Shield up. Divine shield.

Hector reached for another spear. "Deiphobus, give me yours."

No answer. He turned. No one there. Just mist.

He realized. Tricked by a god.

"I'm alone," he whispered.

Achilles closed in. Hector drew his sword. Charged.

Achilles threw his spear. Aimed for the throat.

Hector lifted his shield. The spear hit the shield. Went through. Hit his neck. Not kill shot. But close.

Hector stumbled. Dropped his sword.

Achilles pulled out the spear. Walked up slow.

"This is for Patroclus," he said.

He stabbed. Through the throat. Clean.

Hector fell. Gasping.

"Achilles," he choked out. "Let my family ransom my body. Let them bury me."

Achilles looked down. Cold.

"No. Dogs and birds will eat you. No burial. No ransom."

Hector died.

Achilles tied his ankles together. With the same strap Hector used to drag Patroclus.

He tied it to his chariot. Dragged the body back to the ships. Head bouncing in the dust.

On the wall, Priam saw. He collapsed. Screamed.

Hecuba tore her hair. Fainted.

In the palace, Andromache heard the wailing.

She ran to the wall. Saw the body being dragged.

"HECTOR!" she screamed.

She fell backward. The baby Astyanax fell from her arms. The nurse caught him.

She blacked out.

When she woke, she cried. "My husband. My son is fatherless. Troy is doomed."

The Trojans watched their hero's body disappear.

The Greeks cheered.

But even the Greek leaders were uneasy.

What Achilles did? That was too much.

**End of Book XXII**

# BOOK XXIII

Patroclus came back.

Dead but not. His ghost stood over Achilles. While he slept.

"Yo," the ghost said. "You gonna bury me or what?"

Achilles woke up. Reached for him. Hands passed through mist.

"Can't hug ghosts," Patroclus said. "Listen. Bury me. Let my soul rest. And make it quick. I'm stuck in limbo."

Achilles wept. "I got you. Tomorrow. Big funeral."

The ghost vanished.

Dawn came. Achilles got up. He was still in his divine armor. Hadn't taken it off.

He rounded up the troops.

"Wood," he said. "Lots of it. For Patroclus' pyre."

They cut trees. Pine. Oak. Elm. Made a huge pile. A hundred feet long.

They dragged Hector's body out. Achilles took it off the chariot. Threw it facedown in the dust near the pyre.

The gods were watching. Apollo was pissed.

"He can't do that," Apollo said. "Hector was honorable. Body deserves respect."

Zeus agreed. He sent Iris. "Tell Achilles: stop dragging him. Give him to Priam. But not yet."

Iris delivered the message.

Achilles heard it. Didn't care. "Let them try to take him."

But the gods protected the corpse. They kept it fresh. No decay. No damage. Even dragged through dirt, it looked unmarked.

Morning came. The pyre was ready.

Achilles put Patroclus' body on top. Covered it with locks of hair. Myrmidons cut theirs. Achilles cut a lock he'd been growing for his own death. Gave it to his friend instead.

He put dogs and twelve Trojan captives on the pyre too. Sacrifice.

Lit the fire.

Flames roared. Rose to the sky. Burned all day. Into night.

The Greeks poured wine on the ashes. Gathered the bones. Put them in a golden jar. Oiled. Sealed.

They buried the jar. Piled a mound.

Then Achilles announced games. To honor Patroclus.

Everyone gathered.

"First event," Achilles said. "Chariot race. Best prize: a woman. Skilled. And a tripod. Second prize: a mare. Six years old. Third: a cauldron. Fourth: two talents of gold. Fifth: a new jar."

Five heroes stepped up. Eumelus. Diomedes. Menelaus. Antilochus. Meriones.

They lined up.

Achilles dropped the flag.

They shot forward.

Eumelus took lead. Good charioteer. Good horses.

But Diomedes was close behind. Athena helped him. Made his horses faster.

They reached a marker. Had to turn around it. Hard turn.

Antilochus' horses were slower. He couldn't catch Eumelus or Diomedes. So he cheated.

He pulled his chariot wide. Cut off Menelaus. Forced him to slow down.

Menelaus yelled. "Foul!"

But Antilochus kept going.

At the finish, it was:

1. Diomedes 2. Antilochus 3. Menelaus 4. Eumelus (his chariot broke) 5. Meriones

Achilles gave Diomedes the top prize.

Antilochus got second.

Menelaus got third.

But Menelaus wasn't having it. He stood up. "Antilochus cheated. I demand a rematch."

Antilochus denied it.

"Then swear it," Menelaus said. "Swear you didn't foul me."

Antilochus couldn't lie to the gods. He confessed.

"Fine," he said. "I did it. But out of fear, not malice. My horses are slow."

Menelaus softened. "I forgive you. Keep your prize. I'll take the fourth-place gold."

Achilles nodded. Gave Menelaus the gold.

Then, feeling bad for Eumelus, he gave him the second-place mare anyway.

"Next event," Achilles said. "Boxing."

Epeus stepped up. Big guy. Confident.

"I win," he said. "Anyone wanna try?"

Euryalus accepted.

They put on gloves. Hard leather. Wrapped hands.

They fought. Three rounds.

Epeus hit Euryalus. Hard. In the jaw. He went down. Out.

Winner: Epeus. Got a mule.

"Wrestling," Achilles announced.

Ajax stood. Odysseus stood.

They grappled. Sweaty. Dirty. Matched strength.

Neither could throw the other. They pulled and pushed. Stalemate.

Achilles called it a draw. Split the prize. Each got half the silver.

"Footrace," Achilles said.

Odysseus. Ajax. Antilochus. Lined up.

Athena loved Odysseus. She made him fast. He won.

Antilochus got second. Young and quick.

Ajax, big and heavy, got third.

"Armored combat," Achilles said. "Two-handed."

Diomedes and Ajax suited up. They fought with swords.

They matched blows. Clash. Clash. Clash.

Neither gave. Both were champions.

Achilles stopped it. "Draw. Shared prize."

"Discus," Achilles announced.

Polypoetes threw. Far.

Everyone else fell short.

Winner: Polypoetes. Got a cauldron.

"Archery," Achilles said.

Teucer stepped up. Brother of Ajax. Known archer.

Meriones stepped up. Cretan. Also skilled.

Teucer shot. Fast. Hit the target.

Meriones shot. Hit the target dead center.

Teucer drew again. His bowstring snapped. Bad luck.

Meriones won. Got ten double-bladed axes.

"Spear throw," Achilles said.

Agamemnon stood. No one else did.

Everyone knew he was the best. No contest.

"Fine," Achilles said. "You win. Prize: a woman and a cauldron. Plus the spear you threw."

The games ended.

But Achilles wasn't done grieving.

He went back to Patroclus' mound. Laid down on it. Hugged the dirt.

"Rest, brother," he whispered.

Tomorrow, he'd drag Hector's body around it. Again.

**End of Book XXIII**

# BOOK XXIV

The gods argued again.

Apollo was heated. "This is wrong. Hector always burned offerings for us. And Achilles keeps dragging him. It's disrespectful."

Hera snapped back. "He killed Patroclus. He gets no respect."

Zeus stepped in. "Enough. Send Iris to Priam. Tell him to ransom the body. Bring treasure. Go alone. He won't be harmed."

Iris flashed down. Found Priam weeping in his palace.

"Old man," she said. "Zeus says: go to Achilles. Take gifts. You return with Hector."

Priam called Hecuba. "I'm going."

"Are you crazy?" she yelled. "He'll kill you. Our son is dead. Don't make us lose you too."

"I have to," Priam said. "I saw his body dragged. I can't sleep. Can't eat. I must try."

He ordered treasure loaded. Ten wagons. Gold. Tapestry. Rich robes.

He found his best wagon. Yoked mules. Called for a driver.

His sons tried to stop him. He pushed them away.

Hermes appeared. Disguised as a young guard.

"I'll drive you," he said.

They rolled out at dusk. Through the dark. Past the Greek watchfires.

Hermes made them invisible.

They reached Achilles' tent. The guard dogs didn't bark. The sentries didn't see.

"Here," Hermes whispered. "Go in. I'm out."

Priam climbed down. Walked in.

Achilles was eating. He saw an old man. Anger flashed.

"Who are you?!"

Priam knelt. Grabbed Achilles' knees. Kissed his hands.

"Think of your father," Priam said. "He's old like me. I have lost fifty sons. Hector was my best. My city is destroyed. I risk my life to ask: give me my son's body. Let me bury him."

Achilles looked at him. The grief in the old man's eyes.

Something broke in him. He wept. For his own father. For Patroclus.

"Stand up," he said. "Don't kneel. We both suffer. Sit."

He ordered food. Wine.

They ate together. Two enemies. United by loss.

After, Achilles called for Hector's body.

It was washed. Anointed. Wrapped.

Priam prepared the wagons.

"Stay here tonight," Achilles said. "Sleep. Eat. You can leave at dawn. No harm will come."

Priam agreed.

Achilles gave orders. No Greek would attack. A truce. Eleven days.

The next morning, Priam rolled out. The body in the wagon.

He reached Troy. The whole city came out.

"HECTOR!" the wail went up.

Andromache held the head. Cradled it. "How will I raise our son?"

Helen wept. "You were always kind to me," she said to the dead.

They built the pyre. They burned him. Gathered the bones. Buried them in a golden jar.

They covered it with a mound.

Nine days they mourned.

On the tenth, they feasted.

On the eleventh, they rested.

The war paused.

For now.

**End of Book XXIV**
