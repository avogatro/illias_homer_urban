        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 8</p>

        <h2>Zeus Makes The Rules</h2>
        <p>Zeus woke up and slammed his fist. "Listen up, everyone. Today, I call the shots. No god is allowed to help the Greeks or Trojans."</p>
        <p>"If you even try, I'm throwing you into the deep abyss. No cap."</p>
        <p>He grabbed his thunderbolts and jumped in his chariot. He rode to the highest peak of Mount Ida to watch the show.</p>
        <p>The other gods were forced to sit and watch. They couldn't touch the field.</p>

        <h2>The Trojan Push</h2>
        <p>The battle started. Zeus turned his scales toward the Trojans. The heavy side meant they were winning today.</p>
        <p>Thunder crashed. The Trojans got hype. They attacked like a pack of wolves.</p>
        <p>Hector led the charge. "Today is the day we take their ships!" he yelled.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Nestor's Save</h2>
        <p>The Greeks were getting folded. Teucer, a Greek archer, was sniping Trojans. He killed like 8 guys. But Hector threw a rock and shattered his collarbone.</p>
        <p>Diomedes and Odysseus tried to hold the line. But Zeus threw lightning at them. They felt the fear. They realized the gods were against them today.</p>
        <p>Old Nestor saw Diomedes retreating. "What are you doing?" he yelled.</p>
        <p>Diomedes was salty. "It's Zeus, man. He’s blocking us. But I won't run."</p>
        <p>Nestor grabbed him. "Bro, Hector is possessed by Ares today. You gotta pull back. If we lose you, we lose the war."</p>

        <h2>Agamemnon Panics</h2>
        <p>Agamemnon saw the Greeks running. He started spiraling.</p>
        <p>"It’s over!" he cried. "Zeus hates me. Let's pack the boats. We gotta go home."</p>
        <p>Zeus didn't like that. He sent an eagle with a live snake in its claws.</p>
        <p>The snake bit the eagle, and the eagle dropped it on the altar. The Trojans saw it and were shook. Nestor saw it too.</p>
        <p>"Don't run!" Nestor told Agamemnon. "That's a sign. Even if Zeus wants to play us, we stay and fight. We hold the wall."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Behind the Wall</h2>
        <p>The Greeks barely made it back to their camp. They huddled behind the new wall they built.</p>
        <p>The Trojans stopped just outside. They didn't go home. They posted up right there in the field.</p>
        <p>Hector ordered his squad to set up camp. "No one goes home yet! We build fires and eat. If the Greeks try to use the ships to leave, we attack."</p>
        <p>The Trojans made thousands of campfires. It looked like stars in the sky, but it was just an army waiting to kill.</p>
        <p>Inside the Greek wall, everyone was stressed out. Agamemnon was pacing around. Everyone was blaming him.</p>
        <p>"It's your fault," they said. "You insulted Achilles. Now we're all gonna die."</p>
        <p>Agamemnon was broken. He agreed to send gifts to Achilles and apologize. But the damage was done.</p>
