        <h2>The Heist</h2>
        <p>Menealus saw Patroclus go down. "We can't lose the body," he yelled.</p>
        <p>He stood over Patroclus like a guard dog. He killed anyone who tried to touch the gear.</p>
        <p>But Hector was right there. He yelled to his squad: "Whoever gets the body gets the loot! Let's go!"</p>
        <p>Hector stripped the armor off Patroclus. He was wearing Achilles' legendary gear now.</p>
        <p>Zeus watched Hector put on the helmet. "You look cool," Zeus thought, "but that armor is cursed. It's actually leading to your grave."</p>

        <h2>The Roast</h2>
        <p>Glaucus, the Lycian captain, was heated. He stepped to Hector.</p>
        <p>"Look at you, Hector. You claim you're the leader, but you act like a coward."</p>
        <p>"You let Sarpedon's body get dragged away by the Greeks without saying a word. But now you're fighting hard for this guy? Why? Because you want his shiny armor? You're clout chasing."</p>
        <p>Hector was angry but focused. "Don't test me. I fight for the win. Get your hands dirty."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Mosh Pit</h2>
        <p>The fight turned into a straight-up scrum.</p>
        <p>Ajax the Great came up. "Who touches the body gets wrecked!"</p>
        <p>Athena also showed up in disguise to help the Greeks.</p>
        <p>Zeus was like, "If my son Sarpedon is gone, I don't care if his body gets dragged. I don't care if they strip him."</p>
        <p>But Zeus made sure Apollo saved Sarpedon's body and washed it clean earlier.</p>
        <p>Now, it was all about Patroclus.</p>

        <h2>The Tug-of-War</h2>
        <p>The Greeks were losing. Menelaus knew he couldn't hold the body alone.</p>
        <p>He ran to find Ajax. "Bro, help me. They're gonna take Patroclus to Troy."</p>
        <p>Ajax ran back. He killed a Trojan leader named Hippothous. "Get off him!"</p>
        <p>Then Menelaus dragged the body away. It was gruesome. Blood everywhere.</p>
        <p>Apollo covered the battlefield in a thick fog. It was hard to see. It was chaos.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Escape</h2>
        <p>Athena helped Ajax find his way through the fog. He kept killing Trojans who tried to grab the body.</p>
        <p>Hector chased them, but he couldn't stop the Greek tank.</p>
        <p>The Greeks managed to drag Patroclus' body back behind their wall.</p>
        <p>It wasn't a win. It was just damage control.</p>
        <p>Achilles was about to hear the news.</p>
