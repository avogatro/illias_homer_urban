        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 11</p>

        <h2>Agamemmon's Moment</h2>
        <p>Eos (the Dawn) showed up. Zeus woke up and sent Iris to deliver a message.</p>
        <p>"Hey Agamemnon," Iris whispered. "Get dressed. Zeus wants you to hype your boys up. You're gonna win big today."</p>
        <p>Agamemnon put on his gear. He looked fresh. Massive armor, huge shield, sword like a chopping block.</p>
        <p>The soldiers were hyped. They marched out like a swarm of bees.</p>

        <h2>The Rampage</h2>
        <p>Agamemnon was on one today. He was killing everything that moved.</p>
        <p>Trojan soldiers were scattering. He was chopping them down like a man cutting grass. It was ugly.</p>
        <p>He killed two of Priam’s sons. He killed their charioteers. Blood and dust everywhere.</p>
        <p>The Trojans were folding. They were running back to the city gates.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The L</h2>
        <p>Just as Agamemnon was chasing them, a Trojan named Coon stepped up.</p>
        <p>His brother was just killed by Agamemnon. Coon was mad.</p>
        <p>He snuck up and speared Agamemnon right in the arm. It wasn't a fatal hit, but it hurt bad. He missed the elbow but went through the muscle.</p>
        <p>Agamemnon was shook. He told his charioteer, "Turn this car around. I need to patch this up."</p>
        <p>He dipped from the battlefield. When Hector saw the boss leave, he got hype. "The king is down! Let's push!"</p>

        <h2>Diomedes Out</h2>
        <p>Hector charged into the Greek lines. Diomedes tried to stop him.</p>
        <p>But remember Paris? The guy who started all this? He was hiding behind a rock with his bow.</p>
        <p>He shot Diomedes in the foot. Right in the toes.</p>
        <p>Diomedes cursed at him. "You pretty boy shooter! You aim at the feet because you're scared of the face?"</p>
        <p>He grabbed the arrow, pulled it out, and told his driver to bail. He hopped back to the ships.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Odysseus vs. The Squad</h2>
        <p>Odysseus was left alone. He looked at his squad. Everyone was retreating.</p>
    <p>"What am I, a turtle? I don't run!" he said.</p>
    <p>He stood his ground. He killed a Trojan leader. But then, he got surrounded.</p>
    <p>It was 5 on 1. Then 10 on 1.</p>
    <p>Socus, a Trojan, ran up and speared Odysseus in the ribs. *Shank.* It went deep. Odysseus got dizzy.</p>
    <p>But he threw his spear back and killed Socus. He was bleeding out. He yelled, "Yo, Ajax! Help me!"</p>

        <h2>The Save</h2>
        <p>Ajax the Great heard the scream. He came running like a tank.</p>
        <p>He charged into the crowd. Trojans scattered like bugs.</p>
        <p>Menelaus came too. They grabbed Odysseus and dragged him to safety.</p>
    <p>Odysseus was bleeding all over the chariot. Ajax kept holding the Trojans back while they got away.</p>

    <h2>The Doctor Down</h2>
    <p>Things were looking bad for the Greeks. The Trojans were wilding.</p>
    <p>Achilles (who was still chilling on his boat) saw Nestor driving a wounded soldier to the back.</p>
    <p>It was Machaon, the doctor. He took an arrow in the shoulder.</p>
    <p>Achilles turned to his best friend Patroclus. "Yo, go ask Nestor who that is. Why are they rushing the medic?"</p>
    <p>Patroclus ran off. Little did he know, asking that question was gonna change his life forever.</p>
