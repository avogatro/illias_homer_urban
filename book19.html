        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 19</p>

        <h2>The Glow Up</h2>
        <p>Thetis brought the new gear to Achilles. She dropped it on the ground. It shone like a fire.</p>
        <p>It was loud. The metal clanked. The Myrmidons (Achilles' squad) were scared to even look at it. They scattered.</p>
        <p>But Achilles couldn't take his eyes off it. It was rage mixed with art.</p>
        <p>He put it on. It fit perfectly. He felt powerful.</p>
        <p>Then he screamed.</p>

        <h2>The Battle Cry</h2>
        <p>Thetis filled the air with nectar so he wouldn't starve too fast.</p>
        <p>Achilles let out a roar. Athena added her voice to it.</p>
        <p>It was terrifying. The Trojans heard it and froze. The Greeks heard it and felt sick.</p>
        <p>The sound made 12 Trojans fall off their chariots just from the fright.</p>

        <h2>The Huddle</h2>
        <p>Achilles called the Greek leaders together. He didn't want to fight anymore. He wanted to squash the beef so they could focus on Hector.</p>
        <p>"Agamemnon," Achilles said. "We fought over a girl. It was dumb. But I'm over it. Let's move."</p>
        <p>"Are we sending the army out or nah?"</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The "My Bad"</h2>
        <p>Agamemnon stood up from his seat. "Yo, listen everyone. It wasn't my fault. It was Zeus. He blinded me."</p>
        <p>"I made a mistake. I want to fix it. I’ll give back the girl. I'll give the gifts. I'll throw in extra."</p>
        <p>He called his boys. "Go get the loot. Go get Briseis. Bring it all here."</p>

        <h2>Odysseus Checks Him</h2>
        <p>Odysseus interrupted. "Chill, bro. Don't push the army away just to make a speech."</p>
        <p>Let the men eat first. We can do the whole ceremony with the gifts later. We need to fight NOW."</p>
        <p>Agamemnon agreed. He ordered the Greeks to get a quick meal in.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Briseis Returns</h2>
        <p>The guards brought Briseis out. She walked toward Achilles.</p>
        <p>But when she saw Patroclus’ body, she lost it.</p>
        <p>She fell on the corpse and cried. "You were like a big brother to me," she sobbed. "Achilles is my husband, but you were nice to me. You treated me like a queen."</p>
        <p>All the women wailed with her. Achilles joined in. It was a sad scene.</p>

        <h2>Zero Patience</h2>
        <p>Zeus was watching. He told Hera, "My son isn't eating. He wants revenge."</p>
        <p>Hera said, "Let him starve if he wants. Or let Athena feed him. I don't care."</p>
        <p>Athena flew down. She poured sweet nectar into Achilles' chest. He didn't even know she did it.</p>
        <p>He strapped on his armor. He grabbed his massive spear.</p>
        <p>"I'm done talking," he said. "I'm going for Hector."</p>
