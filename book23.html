        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 23</p>

        <h2>The Pyre</h2>
        <p>Achilles didn't go to sleep. He stayed by the body, crying.</p>
        <p>He cut his hair. He laid it on Patroclus' chest.</p>
        <p>"I promised you, bro," he said. "I got Hector. Now you go."</p>
        <p>They built a massive pyre. It was huge. On top, they put the body. Then Achilles killed sheep, oxen, and fat goats. He burned it all.</p>
        <p>He also killed the 12 Trojan prisoners he caught earlier. Cold-blooded.</p>
        <p>"Go with him," he said. "Serve my bestie in the afterlife."</p>

        <h2>The Games Begin</h2>
        <p>The next day, the ashes were gathered. Then Achilles said, "Let's have a tournament. Prizes for the winners."</p>
        <p>The whole army gathered.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Event 1: Chariot Race (The Grand Prix)</h2>
        <p>Drivers lined up. Eumelus, Diomedes, Menelaus, Antilochus, and Meriones.</p>
        <p>They took off. Eumelus was winning, but Diomedes had the fastest horses.</p>
        <p>Athena helped Diomedes. She smashed Eumelus' chariot. He crashed.</p>
        <p>Diomedes crossed the line first. He won a cauldron and a woman.</p>
        <p>Antilochus came second. He won a mare. But Menelaus was salty.</p>
        <p>"You cut me off!" Menelaus yelled. "That was a dirty move."</p>
        <p>Antilochus apologized. "My bad, boss. I'm young and hype. You take the prize."</p>
        <p>Menelaus forgave him because he was chill like that.</p>

        <h2>Event 2: Boxing</h2>
        <p>Epeus stepped up. He flexed. "I got hands. Watch this."</p>
        <p>Euryalus fought him. Epeus hit him with a left hook. Euryalus went down hard.</p>
        <p>KO. He was dragging his feet. His boys had to carry him off.</p>
        <p>Epeus took the mule.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Event 3: Wrestling</h2>
        <p>Big Ajax vs. Odysseus. Brains vs. Brawn.</p>
        <p>They tried to throw each other. Sweat everywhere. Mud everywhere.</p>
        <p>Odysseus got the takedown, but Ajax tripped him. It was a tie.</p>
        <p>The sun went down. "Stop," Achilles said. "You both win prizes."</p>

        <h2>Event 4: The Footrace</h2>
        <p>Odysseus and Ajax the Lesser (the fast one) were neck and neck.</p>
        <p>Odysseus prayed to Athena.</p>
        <p>Ajax slipped. There was a pile of cow dung (crap) on the track.</p>
        <p>Ajax face-planted into it.</p>
        <p>Odysseus won the race. Ajax came out looking dirty and mad.</p>
        <p>Odysseus laughed. "You talk about speed, but I'm the winner."</p>

        <h2>Event 5: Archery</h2>
        <p>Meriones and Teucer stepped up.</p>
        <p>Achilles set up a dove on a string. Hit the string, win.</p>
        <p>Teucer shot first. He missed the string entirely.</p>
        <p>Meriones shot. He didn't miss. He hit the bird.</p>

        <h2>Event 6: Spear Throwing</h2>
        <p>Agamemnon stood up. "I want to throw."</p>
        <p>Achilles stopped him. "We know you're the strongest boss. You don't need to prove it. Just take the prize."</p>
        <p>So Agamemnon got the trophy without sweating. VIP treatment.</p>
