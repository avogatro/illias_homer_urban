        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 14</p>

        <h2>Hera's Scheme</h2>
        <p>Hera saw Poseidon helping the Greeks. She wanted to help him mess with Zeus.</p>
        <p>She looked at Zeus and saw he was checking her out. She had a plan.</p>
        <p>"I'm gonna distract him with the booty," she thought.</p>
        <p>She went to Aphrodite, the goddess of love.</p>
        <p>"Hey, girl," Hera lied. "I need to go visit Ocean and Tethys. They are fighting. Let me borrow that magic bra. The one that makes you irresistible."</p>
        <p>Aphrodite was suspicious, but she didn't say no. "Here. Take it."</p>

        <h2>The Bribed Nap</h2>
        <p>Next, Hera found Hypnos, the god of Sleep.</p>
        <p>"Listen, I need you to knock Zeus out tonight. I'll pay you big time," she said.</p>
        <p>Hypnos was shaking. "No way. Last time I did that, he threw me into the ocean."</p>
        <p>"I'll give you Pasithea," Hera offered. "She's the prettiest of the Graces. You can marry her."</p>
        <p>Hypnos was down. "Bet. I’m in."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Hookup</h2>
        <p>Hera put on the sexy gear. She smelled amazing. She walked up to Zeus on the mountain.</p>
        <p>Zeus took one look and lost it. "Dayum," he said. "You look better than ever."</p>
        <p>"Come on," Hera said, acting innocent. "Let's go find a spot."</p>
        <p>Zeus was simping hard. "If we go there, I don't think I can control myself."</p>
        <p>They went into a cave. They got busy. A gold cloud covered them.</p>

        <h2>The Knockout</h2>
        <p>As soon as Zeus was... relaxed, Hypnos hit him.</p>
        <p>*Pow.*</p>
        <p>Zeus was out cold. Heavy snoring.</p>
        <p>Hypnos ran to tell Poseidon. "The boss is asleep. Do your thing."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Earthquake</h2>
        <p>Poseidon got hype. "Zeus is napping! I'm in charge now!"</p>
        <p>He ran to the front lines. He yelled, "Why are we losing? We are way stronger!"</p>
        <p>He got in the chariot and caused a massive earthquake.</p>
        <p>The ground shook. The Trojan horses panicked.</p>

        <h2>The Comeback</h2>
        <p>Ajax the Great saw his chance. "Boys, Zeus is asleep! Let's kill 'em!"</p>
        <p>The Greeks pushed forward. It was a massacre.</p>
        <p>Ajax speared a guy named Hippothous right through the chest.</p>
        <p>Hector tried to keep his squad together, but they were terrified of Poseidon.</p>
        <p>Even the smart Trojans were like, "We shouldn't have messed with these Greeks."</p>
        <p>The Greeks started winning. Thanks to a nap.</p>
