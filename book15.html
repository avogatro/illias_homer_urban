        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 15</p>

        <h2>The Hangover</h2>
        <p>Zeus woke up. He saw the Trojans were losing big time.</p>
        <p>He saw Hector on the ground, gasping for air. He saw Poseideon helping the Greeks.</p>
        <p>He looked at Hera. "I see you," he said. "You played me. You distracted me with the vibes."</p>
        <p>Hera tried to play innocent. "I didn't do anything!"</p>
        <p>Zeus wasn't having it. "You're lucky I don't end you right now. But we got rules. You gotta watch your mouth."</p>

        <h2>Getting the Squad in Line</h2>
        <p>Zeus ordered Hera to call the other gods.</p>
        <p>"Tell them if they help the Trojans or Greeks today, I'm throwing them into the deepest pit. No cap."</p>
        <p>Then he turned to Apollo. "You're too busy feeling sorry for Hector. Get back in the game."</p>
        <p>Then he called Poseidon. "Get out. Go home to the sea. Unless you want to fight me."</p>
        <p>Poseideon was salty. "Zeus, I'm your brother! You acting high and mighty."</p>
        <p>Zeus threatened him again. Poseideon sighed. "Fine. I dip." He walked away into the ocean.</p>

        <h2>Hector's 2.0 Update</h2>
        <p>Zeus turned back to Apollo. "Go heal Hector. Give him strength. Make the Greeks run again."</p>
        <p>Apollo flew down. He poured power into Hector.</p>
        <p>Hector got up like he was glitching. He felt fresh. He put his armor back on.</p>
        <p>The Trojans cheered when they saw their boss back on his feet.</p>
        <p>The Greeks saw it too and their stomachs dropped.</p>

        <h2>The Rush to the Sea</h2>
        <p>Teucer, a Greek archer, tried to snipe Hector. But Hector threw a rock and smashed his collarbone again.</p>
        <p>"Nobody can stop me!" Hector yelled.</p>
        <p>The Greeks broke formation. They ran screaming from the wall all the way to the beach.</p>
        <p>They were fighting literally by the water's edge now.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Fire</h2>
        <p>Patroclus (Achilles' bestie) saw the smoke. The Trojans were setting their ships on fire.</p>
        <p>He ran back to Achilles. "Man, look," he said. "Our boys are getting cooked."</p>
        <p>Achilles was still salty. "So?"</p>
        <p>"If they burn the ships, we can't go home," Patroclus said. "Let me take your armor. Maybe if they see 'Achilles' coming out, they'll freeze."</p>
        <p>Achilles thought about it. "Alright. But don't get cocky. Just save the ships and come back."</p>
        <p>But it was too late. The Trojans were at the front door.</p>
