        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 12</p>

        <h2>The Sign</h2>
        <p>Zeus kept the Trojans hyped all night. He was throwing thunderbolts like fireworks.</p>
        <p>The next morning, the Trojans advanced on the Greek wall. They were confident.</p>
        <p>Polydamas, a smart Trojan captain, pulled Hector aside.</p>
        <p>"Yo, look at this bird sign," he said. "A hawk just snatched a dove but the dove fought back. I think it means if we cross the wall, we’re gonna get cooked. Let's stay back and attack with spears."</p>
        <p>Hector wasn't feeling it. "You talk too much," he said. "If you're scared, go home. We’re attacking. Zeus is on our side."</p>

        <h2>The Rush</h2>
        <p>Hector ordered the charge. But the Greek wall was strong. There was a huge ditch in front of it.</p>
        <p>Trojan chariots couldn't get across easily. They got stuck.</p>
        <p>So the Trojans had to go on foot. It was chaotic.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Trap at the Gate</h2>
        <p>One Trojan captain, Asius, saw a gate that was left open. He tried to rush in.</p>
        <p>"Easy pickings!" he thought.</p>
        <p>Wrong move. It was a trap. Two Greek beasts, Leonteus and Polypoetes, were hiding there.</p>
        <p>They jumped him and his squad. It was a slaughter. Asius died fast. The Trojans realized, "Oh, this wall isn't a joke."</p>

        <h2>Hector's Cannonball</h2>
        <p>Hector was frustrated. He saw the Greeks holding the line.</p>
        <p>He shouted to the captains. "Bring me the biggest rocks you can find!"</p>
        <p>He picked up a stone that not even two normal men could lift. He chucked it right at the wooden double doors of the main gate.</p>
        <p>BOOM!</p>
        <p>The doors shattered. The hinges flew off. The stones crumbled. There was a hole in the defense.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Sarpedon's Speech</h2>
        <p>The Trojans stormed the breach. But the Greeks fought back.</p>
        <p>Sarpedon (the King of the Lycians) rallied his men. He gave a legendary speech.</p>
        <p>"Listen, bros. Why are we sitting in the back line getting respect? We need to earn it."</p>
        <p>"If we die today, at least we die as legends. Let's grab the wall!"</p>
        <p>He grabbed his shield and rushed the ramparts. He was fearless.</p>

        <h2>The Wall War</h2>
        <p>Sarpedon and Hector climbed the wall. The Greeks were terrified.</p>
        <p>Ajax the Great was there, trying to hold the line. He was knocking guys off the wall with stones.</p>
        <p>Ajax yelled at Teucer, the archer. "Where have you been? Shoot these guys!"</p>
        <p>But Zeus made Teucer's bowstring snap. He shot his brother by accident (lightly).</p>
        <p>It was total chaos. The Greeks were fighting for their lives, literally standing on the stones of their own wall.</p>
