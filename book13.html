        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 13</p>

        <h2>Poseidon Makes a Move</h2>
        <p>While Zeus was chillin' on the mountain, Poseidon was watching the Greeks get wrecked.</p>
        <p>He felt bad for them. He was like, "Nah, I can't let them die."</p>
        <p>He snuck out of the ocean. He was careful not to let Zeus see him. Zeus was distracted, looking the other way.</p>
        <p>Poseidon put on a disguise. He looked like a random human prophet.</p>

        <h2>The Pep Talk</h2>
        <p>Poseidon ran straight to the two Ajaxes (Big Ajax and Little Ajax).</p>
        <p>"Yo, listen," he whispered. "If you guys wanna survive, you gotta toughen up. Hector thinks he's winning. You gotta shut him down."</p>
        <p>He didn't just talk. He hit them with a magical energy boost. Suddenly, the Ajaxes felt unstoppable. They were ready to run through a wall.</p>
        <p>Poseidon kept running down the line, hyping everyone up. "Do it for your ships! Do it for your lives!"</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Idomeneus the Savage</h2>
        <p>Then Poseidon found Idomeneus, a Cretan captain.</p>
        <p>"You're the man, Idomeneus. Where's your spear at?"</p>
        <p>Idomeneus was hyped. "I'm ready."</p>
        <p>He saw a Trojan friend named Meriones. "Yo, give me a spear. I left mine in the tent."</p>
        <p>Meriones gave him a good bronze one. "Here. Don't miss."</p>

        <h2>The Rampage</h2>
        <p>Idomeneus started killing everyone. He was in the zone.</p>
        <p>He dropped a Trojan named Othryoneus who just showed up trying to marry Cassandra.</p>
        <p>"Nice try, bro," Idomeneus said. "You said you'd kick the Greeks out. Look at you now. Dead."</p>
        <p>He killed like 5 guys in a row. He was showing off.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Deiphobus vs. Idomeneus</h2>
        <p>A Trojan prince named Deiphobus saw Idomeneus flexing.</p>
        <p>He challenged him. "You think you're hard? Watch this."</p>
        <p>He threw his spear. It hit Idomeneus' shield.</p>
        <p>Idomeneus threw his back. *SHANK.* It went right into Deiphobus' gut.</p>
        <p>Deiphobus was screaming in pain. His brother ran over to carry him away. It was a mess.</p>

        <h2>The Wall Holds</h2>
        <p>With Poseidon's magic buffing them, the Greeks pushed back hard.</p>
        <p>The Trojans stopped laughing. They were getting pushed away from the ships.</p>
        <p>Hector was still fighting, but his squad was crumbling. The wall was safe for now.</p>
        <p>Poseidon kept cheering from the sidelines. "Keep pushing! Don't let them win!"</p>
