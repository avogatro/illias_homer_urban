        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 22</p>

        <h2>The Trick</h2>
        <p>The Trojans were hiding inside the city walls. Only Hector was left outside.</p>
        <p>Apollo, who was posing as a Trojan, appeared to Hector.</p>
        <p>"Hey, why are you chasing Achilles? You're just running in circles," Apollo said.</p>
        <p>But then Apollo revealed himself. "Peace out," he said, and vanished.</p>
        <p>Hector realized he had been played. He stood there, alone.</p>

        <h2>The Plea</h2>
        <p>Old King Priam saw Achilles walking toward the city. He saw the look in Achilles' eyes. It was the look of death.</p>
        <p>"Hector!" Priam screamed from the wall. "Please, come inside! You're the only hope left for this city. Don't throw your life away!"</p>
        <p>His mom, Hecuba, started crying. "She showed her breast. "Hector, have mercy on me! Don't let him kill you!"</p>
        <p>But Hector stood firm. He couldn't leave. He was too embarrassed.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Chase</h2>
        <p>Achilles got closer. Hector's courage faded.</p>
        <p>"Oh snap," Hector thought. "I'm done for."</p>
        <p>He dropped his shield and turned to run. Achilles took off after him.</p>
        <p>They didn't run in a straight line. They ran around the city walls. Three full laps.</p>
        <p>It wasn't a race. It was a hunt. Achilles was a cheetah. Hector was a stag trying to escape.</p>

        <h2>The Gods' Commentary</h2>
        <p>Zeus was watching. "Should we save Hector?" he asked the other gods.</p>
        <p>"He's a good guy. He burns sacrifices to us."</p>
        <p>Athena snapped. "Dad, stop. Hector is dead meat. His time is up."</p>
        <p>Zeus agreed. "Bet. Do what you want."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Fake Out</h2>
        <p>Hector was exhausted. Achilles was like the Terminator—he never got tired.</p>
        <p>Athena appeared to Hector in the form of his brother, Deiphobus.</p>
        <p>"Bro!" the fake brother said. "Let's stand together. We can take him."</p>
        <p>Hector was hyped. He stopped running.</p>
        <p>"Deiphobus, you’re the real MVP for standing with me," Hector said.</p>

        <h2>The Final Stand</h2>
        <p>Hector yelled at Achilles. "I'm done running. Let's end this. We agree, winner strips the loser's armor and gives the body back. No disrespect."</p>
        <p>Achilles laughed. "Are you high? I can't promise you that. I'm gonna kill you, strip you, and let the dogs eat you."</p>
        <p>He threw his spear. It went right through Hector's neck.</p>

        <h2>The End</h2>
        <p>Hector fell. "I see you now," he whispered. "You tricked me, Athena. You weren't my brother."</p>
        <p>"Die happy," Achilles said. "They can't save you."</p>
        <p>Hector died. His soul fled to Hades.</p>
        <p>Achilles stripped Hector of his armor. The good armor—the armor he stole from Patroclus.</p>

        <h2>The Dragging</h2>
        <p>Achilles pierced Hector's heels with leather straps. He tied the ropes to his chariot.</p>
        <p>He whipped the horses. The chariot zoomed off. Hector's head bumped and dragged through the dust.</p>
        <p>His wife, Andromache, saw it from the wall. She dropped the veil she was wearing. She fainted.</p>
        <p>The whole city screamed. It was the darkest day of the war.</p>
