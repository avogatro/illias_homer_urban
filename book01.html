        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 1</p>
        
        <h2>The Rage</h2>
        <p>Yo, listen up, Goddess. Sing about the rage of Achilles. Peleus’ son. The man was pressed. And that anger brought mad pain to the Greeks. It sent a lot of tough souls to Hades. Their bodies got left for the dogs and birds to eat. Zeus’ plan was fulfilled.</p>
        <p>Check it—it all started when Agamemnon and Achilles clashed. Which king of the gods sparked this drama?</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Plague</h2>
        <p>Apollo sent a nasty plague. The army was getting wrecked. First, he hit the mules and dogs. Then he hit the soldiers. Bodies were dropping everywhere. Pyres were burning non-stop.</p>

        <h2>Chryses Steps In</h2>
        <p>Chryses, a priest of Apollo, rolled up. He had a deal for the Greeks. "Agamemnon, Menelaus, y’all Greeks," he said. "The gods helped you trash Troy. Now, please accept this ransom. Take my daughter back."</p>
        <p>The whole army was like, "Yeah, respect the priest. Take the gold." But Agamemnon wasn't having it.</p>
        <p>"Nah," he said. "Get out of here before I catch a case." He told the old man to bounce and not come back.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Apollo Strikes Back</h2>
        <p>The old priest was scared but dipped. He prayed hard to Apollo. "Yo, Silver Bow God. You protect Chryse and holy Cilla. Hear me. Make the Greeks pay for my disrespect."</p>
        <p>Apollo heard him. He came down from Olympus mad as hell. He had his silver bow out. He moved like the night. He let arrows fly on the Greeks. The clang of his bow was terrifying. He shot for days. The funeral fires burned constantly.</p>

        <h2>Achilles Calls a Meeting</h2>
        <p>Achilles saw the chaos. He called a meeting. "Hera's man," he said, talking to Agamemnon. "We gotta fix this. Or we’re all gonna die from this plague."</p>
        <p>Calchas, the prophet, stood up. He knew the future. He spoke up. "Achilles, you got my back? Cause Agamemnon hates me. He's the boss, but he gets salty when I speak truth."</p>
        <p>Achilles checked him. "Say what you gotta say. I swear by Apollo, nobody will hurt you."</p>
        <p>So Calchas spilled the tea. "It ain't a sacrifice the gods want. It's Agamemnon dissing Chryses. He gotta give the daughter back. No ransom. And he gotta send a sacrifice to Chryse."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Betrayal</h2>
        <p>Agamemnon stood up. He was heated. "Damn it, prophet! You always got bad news for me."</p>
        <p>He looked at the army. "I wanted the girl. I like her more than my wife. But okay, I'll give her back to save the army. But y’all gotta pay me back. I'm not taking the loss alone."</p>
        <p>Achilles stepped in. "You greedy son of a..." he shouted. "We all here fighting. You sitting back taking the best loot. If we take loot from the towns, I get nothing? That's cap. Nah, I'm done. I'm going home."</p>
        <p>Agamemnon didn't care. "Fine. Take your toys and go. I got other soldiers. But listen close—I'm coming for your prize, Briseis. I'm taking her just to prove I'm the boss."</p>

        <h2>The Standoff</h2>
        <p>Achilles was furious. He grabbed his sword handle. He was about to end Agamemnon right there.</p>
        <p>But Athena appeared invisible. She grabbed his hair. "Chill," she whispered. "Don't kill him, but you can roast him."</p>
        <p>Achilles listened. He dropped his sword but dropped bars too. "You drunk, dog-faced coward," Achilles yelled. "You wear armor like a boss, but you got no heart. I'm done helping you. Keep your girl. I swear by my scepter, one day you'll beg for my help, and I won't be there."</p>

        <h2>The Prayer</h2>
        <p>Achilles dipped. He sat by the black ships and cried. He called his mom, Thetis. She came out of the water. "Why are you crying, son?"</p>
        <p>"Agamemnon played me," Achilles said. "He stole my girl."</p>
        <p>Thetis was heated. "I'm going to talk to the big man, Zeus. He's gonna make the Trojans win until the Greeks respect you."</p>
        <p>She went to Olympus. She found Zeus sitting on the highest peak. She grabbed his knees and touched his chin. "Zeus, Daddy, help my boy. Make the Trojans push the Greeks back. Let Agamemnon know he messed up."</p>

        <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
        <p>Zeus stayed silent for a minute. "If I do this, Hera gonna beef. She hates Trojans." But he nodded. "Bet. It's done."</p>
        <p>Hera saw the nod. She stepped to Zeus. "Who you planning with now?" Zeus wasn't scared. "Mind your business. Go sit down." Hera got scared and shut up.</p>
        <p>The gods had a feast, getting turnt on nectar. Meanwhile, the Greeks went to bed, stressed out. And Agamemnon sent his boys to take Briseis from Achilles. Achilles let them go. He didn't fight back. He just walked to the ocean and prayed to his mom.</p>
        <p>"Mom, he actually took her." Thetis heard him from the deep. She went to Hephaestus to get new armor for her boy. Cause the war was about to get real.</p>
