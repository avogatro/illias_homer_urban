        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 9</p>

        <h2>The Panic Attack</h2>
        <p>Agamemnon was shook. The Greeks were hiding in their ships, terrified of Hector.</p>
        <p>He called a meeting. "I'm done," he said. "Zeus is clearly hating on me. Let's pack up and leave."</p>
        <p>Diomedes wasn't having it. "You can run if you want, but I'm staying. The others will agree with me."</p>
        <p>Nestor stepped up. "Don't be a coward. But listen, we messed up with Achilles. We need to fix it."</p>

        <h2>The Peace Offering</h2>
        <p>Agamemnon realized he was wrong. He decided to send a "goody bag" to Achilles to apologize.</p>
        <p>"I'll give him huge gifts," Agamemnon said. "7 cities, gold, and Briseis back. I swear, I didn't touch her. She's still fresh."</p>
        <p>He picked a top-tier squad to deliver the message. The smooth talkers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Odysseus (The smart one)</li>
            <li>Phoenix (Achilles' old mentor)</li>
            <li>Ajax (The tank)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Tent Visit</h2>
        <p>The crew walked along the beach. They found Achilles chilling, playing his lyre like he didn't have a care in the world.</p>
        <p>Patroclus, his best friend, was there. He served the boys some food and drinks.</p>
        <p>Odysseus stood up first. He started his speech.</p>

        <h2>The Pitch</h2>
        <p>"Yo, Achilles. The situation is bad. The Trojans are pushing up on our ships. Hector is scary out there."</p>
        <p>"Agamemnon knows he messed up. He's sorry. Look at what he’s offering: Infinite gold, horses, and 7 of the finest women."</p>
        <p>"Plus, he's giving you one of his daughters. If you come back now, you get a massive dowry. You'd be rich."</p>

        <h2>The Hard No</h2>
        <p>Achilles rolled his eyes. "Odysseus, stop with the cap. I don't care about money."</p>
        <p>"We all have the same destiny. We all die eventually. Cowards die, heroes die. It doesn't matter."</p>
        <p>"Agamemnon took my girl. Nothing he gives me now fixes that disrespect. I'm going home. I want a wife, not war."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Dad Talk</h2>
        <p>Phoenix started crying. He was the one who raised Achilles when he was a kid.</p>
        <p>"Son, don't be like that. Look at the story of Meleager. He got mad at his family and sat out a war. By the time he cooled down, his people had already paid him off with less loot."</p>
        <p>"Don't wait until the city is on fire to fight. Take the gifts now."</p>
        <p>Achilles was still stubborn. "I like you, Phoenix. You raised me. But I still say no. The anger tastes too good right now."</p>

        <h2>The Honest Truth</h2>
        <p>Ajax the Great stood up. He didn't use fancy words. He kept it 100.</p>
        <p>"He’s stubborn," Ajax said. "You can offer him the world, he won't take it. He’s holding a grudge too hard."</p>
        <p>"Let's just go back and tell the truth. The Greeks are on their own."</p>

        <h2>The Failure</h2>
        <p>They walked back. The whole Greek army was waiting.</p>
        <p>"So?" they asked. "Is he coming?"</p>
        <p>Odysseus shook his head. "Nope. He's too salty."</p>
        <p>The army went silent. Everyone was terrified. They spent the night praying and watching Hector light bonfires by their wall.</p>
