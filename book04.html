        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 4</p>

        <h2>The God Meeting</h2>
        <p>Up on Olympus, the gods were chilling. Zeus looked down at the battlefield.</p>
        <p>"Yo, this truce is beautiful," he said. "Maybe we should just end the war now. Let Menelaus keep his win."</p>
        <p>Hera, who absolutely hates the Trojans, was not having it. She rolled her eyes.</p>
        <p>"Are you serious?" she snapped. "You just gonna let them off the hook? All my effort wasted?"</p>
        <p>Zeus knew better than to argue. "Fine, fine. You win. Do what you want. But expect me to be mad."</p>

        <h2>Athena's Scheme</h2>
        <p>Hera gathered the troops. She told Athena, "Go down there. Make sure the Trojans break the truce first. We need a reason to crash out on them."</p>
        <p>Athena was down. She transformed herself to look like a Trojan soldier. She found a guy named Pandarus.</p>
        <p>This Pandarus was a sniper. He had a crazy bow. Athena whispered in his ear.</p>
        <p>"Hey, pretty boy," she lied. "Look at Menelaus standing there like a boss. If you snipe him right now, you’ll be famous. You’ll get so much clout."</p>
        <p>Pandarus was dumb enough to listen.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Cheap Shot</h2>
        <p>Pandarus pulled out his bow. It was made from antelope horns—top-tier gear. He prayed to Apollo.</p>
        <p>He took aim. He released the string. The arrow flew fast and silent.</p>
        <p>*Thwack.*</p>
        <p>It hit Menelaus. It didn't kill him, thank the gods. It went through his gear and grazed his skin, drawing blood. But it looked way worse than it was.</p>

        <h2>Agamemnon Freaks Out</h2>
        <p>When Agamemnon saw his brother hit, he panicked.</p>
        <p>"Oh my god! He's dead! The truce is broken! This is exactly why you can't trust Trojans!"</p>
        <p>He was ready to burn the whole place down. "We’re going to lose this war without him!"</p>
        
        <h2>The Doctor</h2>
        <p>But the medic, Machaon, stepped up. "Hold up," he said. "Let me check him."</p>
        <p>He examined the wound. He pulled out the arrow. He sucked out the blood and applied some special ointment.</p>
        <p>"He's good," Machaon said. "It's just a scratch. The armor saved him."</p>
        <p>Menelaus got back up, ready to fight. The army was hyped again.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Hype Speech</h2>
        <p>Agamemnon took the mic. He started roasting his own troops to get them motivated.</p>
        <p>"Look at you cowards," he yelled. "You act tough, but you just wanna run away. If you leave now, you go home broke."</p>
        <p>Then he praised the kings. He went to Odysseus. "You keep it real, son. You don't talk much, but when you fight, you fight."</p>
        <p>He went to Agamemnon (himself) and Ajax. "These guys are beasts."</p>
        <p>He even roasted Idomeneus a little. Just to keep everyone on their toes.</p>

        <h2>The Clash</h2>
        <p>The horns blew. *TOOOOT. TOOOOT.*</p>
        <p>The Greeks marched forward like a tidal wave. The Trojans screamed back and charged.</p>
        <p>They collided in the middle of the plain. Shields crashed against spears. It was a brawl.</p>
        <p>Blood started flowing immediately. It was chaos. No more truce. It was straight murder.</p>
        <p>Simoisius, a young Trojan, got killed by Ajax. He didn't even know what hit him.</p>
        <p>Antilochus, a Greek, killed a Trojan guy named Echepolus with a rock to the head. Straight up dropped him.</p>
        <p>The bodies started piling up. Dust covered everyone. The war was back on.</p>
