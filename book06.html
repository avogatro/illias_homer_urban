        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 6</p>

        <h2>Cold-Blooded</h2>
        <p>The battle kept raging. The gods were just chilling, watching humans destroy each other.</p>
        <p>Diomedes was still in the zone. He took a Trojan named Adrestus alive. The guy was begging for his life.</p>
        <p>"Please," he cried. "My dad is rich! He'll pay you huge ransom!"</p>
        <p>Diomedes was about to listen, but Agamemnon cut in.</p>
        <p>"No, son," Agamemnon said. "Don't get soft. If you let them go, they just come back to fight us. Leave no survivors."</p>
        <p>So Diomedes did the dirty work. He killed the guy. Brutal.</p>

        <h2>The Trojan Plan</h2>
        <p>The Greeks were pushing hard. The Trojans were folding.</p>
        <p>Helenus, a Trojan prophet, saw what was happening. He pulled Hector aside.</p>
        <p>"Hector, listen. We losing bad. You need to go back to the city," he said.</p>
        <p>"Tell our mom to gather the ladies. Tell them to go to Athena’s temple and offer her a fancy dress. Pray for mercy. Maybe she’ll chill out on us."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Back in Troy</h2>
        <p>Hector bounced from the fight. The Greeks tried to shoot arrows at him, but his armor was too thick.</p>
        <p>He got to the city gates and met his mom, Hecuba.</p>
        <p>"Ma, don't give me wine," Hector said. "I'm weak. I need to be sober. Go tell the ladies to sacrifice to Athena. Give her the best dress in your closet."</p>
        <p>Hecuba did exactly that. She told the Trojan women to bring an offering.</p>
        <p>They prayed hard. But Athena left them on read. She wasn't interested.</p>

        <h2>The Paris Roast</h2>
        <p>Hector went to find his brother Paris. He found him at home, polishing his armor like a model.</p>
        <p>Hector was heated. "So you here playing dress-up while our boys die out there?" he yelled.</p>
        <p>"The war is your fault, bro. You stole the girl, now you can't even fight for her?"</p>
        <p>Paris looked guilty. "My bad, Hector," he said. "I wasn't trying to slack. I was waiting for my squad. I'll go fight now."</p>
        <p>Hector calmed down. "Good. Come on. We gonna need you."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Goodbye</h2>
        <p>Before going back to war, Hector stopped to see his wife, Andromache.</p>
        <p>She wasn't at home. She ran to the city wall to look for him.</p>
        <p>When she saw him, she burst into tears.</p>
        <p>"You're too brave, Hector," she said. "You're gonna get yourself killed. Then the Greeks will take our son, Astyanax, and throw him off the walls. Or make him a slave. I'll be a widow. It’s too much."</p>

        <h2>The Baby</h2>
        <p>Hector took off his helmet. His wife was scared of it. He held his son.</p>
        <p>But the baby started crying. The helmet was scary, and the plume on top made him nervous.</p>
        <p>Hector laughed. He took the helmet off and set it on the ground. He kissed his baby.</p>
        <p>Then he prayed. "Zeus, let this boy be a better man than me. Let him be strong. Let him bring joy to his mom."</p>

        <h2>The Motivation</h2>
        <p>Hector looked at his wife. "I know, babe. I worry too. But I can't just chill inside."</p>
        <p>"If I act like a coward, what will people say? If I don't fight, I'm dishonoring myself and my ancestors."</p>
        <p>"My heart hurts thinking about you getting dragged away by Greeks. But I have to do this."</p>
        <p>He reached for his baby, but the kid clung to his mom’s dress. Hector smiled, touched his son's hair, and put his helmet back on.</p>
        <p>He walked away. Andromache watched him go, crying like she was already at his funeral.</p>
        <p>Hector went back to the gates. The war was waiting.</p>
