        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 3</p>

        <h2>The 1v1 Challenge</h2>
        <p>The two armies marched toward each other like two giant waves about to crash. The dust was kicking up, and the noise was insane.</p>
        <p>Then, Paris stepped out from the Trojan line. He looked fresh. He had leopard skin on his shoulders, a shiny sword, and two bronze spears.</p>
        <p>He challenged the Greeks to a duel. "Yo, listen up!" he yelled. "Let's stop this big war. I want to fight Menelaus 1v1. Winner takes Helen and all the loot. If I win, y'all go home. If he wins, I take the L and you guys can keep her."</p>
        
        <h2>The Reaction</h2>
        <p>Menelaus heard this and got super hyped. "Finally! This is what I wanted. Let's end this now."</p>
        <p>The Greek army was silent for a second, then went crazy. They wanted this beef over with. Nobody wanted to die because Paris was acting thirsty.</p>
        <p>Hector, Paris's brother, wasn't happy though. He knew Paris was soft. "Bro, you look tough now, but you ain't about that life," he whispered. "You want to fight a man who ate you alive last time?"</p>
        <p>Paris flexed back. "Chill, Hector. Don't hate the player. Just get the priests so we can do the oath."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Helen on the Balcony</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, old King Priam was sitting on the wall of Troy with the elders. He saw Helen walking up and called her over.</p>
        <p>"Come here, sweetheart. Point out the Greek soldiers for me. Who's that big tank down there?"</p>
        <p>Helen looked sad. She felt guilty. "Respectfully, Dad," she said. "I wish I died before I ran off with Paris. But fine, I'll tell you."</p>
        <p>"That's Agamemnon," she said. "The boss. He's wide and powerful."</p>
        <p>"That's Odysseus. He looks small, but he's the smartest guy out there. A master strategist."</p>
        <p>"And that giant wall of muscle? That's Ajax. He holds the line like a human shield."</p>
        <p>Priam looked at them and nodded. "You are beautiful, child. But the gods really cursed us with this mess."</p>

        <h2>The Oath</h2>
        <p>Back on the battlefield, Hector went to the middle of the field. He stopped the armies from fighting. "Hold up!" he yelled.</p>
        <p>Agamemnon told his squad to drop their weapons. Hector did the same.</p>
        <p>Agamemnon and Hector met in the middle to make the deal official. They brought out a ram and a lamb to sacrifice to Zeus.</p>
        <p>The deal was this: If Paris wins, the Greeks leave. If Menelaus wins, the Trojans give Helen back and pay for the stolen goods. If anyone breaks the truce, Zeus destroys them.</p>
        <p>Everyone poured wine on the ground. "If anyone breaks this oath, may their brains melt like this wine," they swore.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Fight</h2>
        <p>They put the names in a helmet and shook them. Paris's name popped out. He had to throw the first spear.</p>
        <p>He geared up. He threw that spear hard. It hit Menelaus’s shield—CLANG—but just bounced off. The shield was too strong.</p>
        <p>Menelaus didn't flinch. He grabbed his own spear. "My turn."</p>
        <p>He threw it like a sniper. It went right through Paris's shield and tore his armor. It scratched him, but Paris dipped out of the way just in time. It didn't kill him.</p>
        <p>Menelaus drew his sword. He rushed Paris and swung for the fences. But the sword shattered on the helmet! The metal broke into pieces.</p>
        <p>"Damn it!" Menelaus yelled. He was weaponless. But he didn't quit. He grabbed Paris by the helmet strap and started dragging him back to the Greek lines.</p>
        <p>Paris was tripping. The strap was choking him. He was done for. Menelaus was pulling him like a ragdoll.</p>

        <h2>The Cheat Code</h2>
        <p>Just as Menelaus was about to finish him, Aphrodite—the goddess who is obsessed with Paris—saw he was losing.</p>
        <p>She was like, "Oh no, my boy is getting cooked."</p>
        <p>She used her god powers. She snapped the strap of the helmet. Menelaus was left holding an empty helmet. He spun around confused. "Where he go?!"</p>
        <p>Aphrodite grabbed Paris, wrapped him in a cloud of mist, and teleported him to his bedroom. Safe and sound. Like a total glitch in the game.</p>
        
        <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
        <p>Menelaus was furious. He was looking everywhere. "He just vanished! That's impossible."</p>
        <p>Aphrodite went to get Helen. "Come to the bedroom," she said. "Paris wants you. He's looking cute and sad."</p>
        <p>Helen wasn't buying it. "Don't play with me," she said. "I'm not going to sleep with that loser. I'm done."</p>
        <p>But Aphrodite threatened her. So Helen went.</p>
        <p>Back on the field, Agamemnon was hyping his side. "Menelaus won! The Trojans gotta pay up!"</p>
        <p>The Greeks were ready to fight again.</p>
