        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 18</p>

        <h2>The News Drops</h2>
        <p>Antilochus ran to Achilles. He was crying. He couldn't look Achilles in the face.</p>
        <p>"Yo, Patroclus..." he choked out. "He's gone. The Trojans wrecked him."</p>
        <p>Achilles went cold. Then he exploded.</p>
        <p>He grabbed dust and poured it over his head. He fell on the ground and wailed. His scream was so loud it shook the tent.</p>
        <p>His mom, Thetis, heard it from the deep ocean. She started screaming too. Her sisters came to comfort her.</p>

        <h2>Thetis & Achilles</h2>
        <p>Thetis flew out of the water. She found Achilles holding Patroclus' body.</p>
        <p>"Why are you crying, son? You're doomed to die young. I know that. But you're still here," she said.</p>
        <p>"Hector killed him," Achilles sobbed. "Patroclus took my armor. I didn't help him. I'm gonna kill Hector. Then I'll die myself. I don't care."</p>
        <p>"But I have no armor!" he said. "Hector has my gear."</p>
        <p>"Don't worry," Thetis said. "I'll get you new stuff. Better stuff. Don't go out yet. Wait."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Pushback</h2>
        <p>While the gods were talking, the fight over the body was getting ugly.</p>
        <p>Hector was trying to drag the body to Troy, but Menelaus rallied the Greeks.</p>
        <p>"You really think you're gonna drag him to the city?" Menelaus yelled. "Not on my watch."</p>
        <p>Ajax the Great started throwing rocks. He killed a Trojan leader named Hippothous.</p>
        <p>The Trojans got scared. They couldn't even touch the body without getting speared.</p>
        <p>Apollo stepped in to protect Hector. "Get back, Hector!" he whispered. "The Greeks are crazy right now."</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Blacksmith</h2>
        <p>Thetis went to Hephaestus, the god of fire and metalworking.</p>
        <p>She found him sweating over his forge. He was making robots for his shop.</p>
        <p>"Son," she said. "My boy needs armor. Now."</p>
        <p>Hephaestus was down. "Your boy saved my life once. I owe you."</p>
        <p>He started working. He put gold, tin, silver, and bronze into the fire.</p>

        <h2>The Shield of Achilles</h2>
        <p>Hephaestus made a shield. It wasn't just a shield. It was a masterpiece. He basically painted the world on it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Cosmos:</strong> Earth, sky, sea, sun, moon, and all the stars.</li>
            <li><strong>Two Cities:</strong> One having a wedding and a court case (Peace). One being raided and soldiers fighting (War).</li>
            <li><strong>The Farm:</strong> Plowmen working the fields, reapers cutting wheat, kids stealing grapes.</li>
            <li><strong>The Animals:</strong> Herds of cows being attacked by lions, shepherds and dogs trying to fight back.</li>
            <li><strong>The Dance:</strong> A dance floor with a kid playing the lyre and couples dancing in a circle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He made the armor shiny and gold. He handed it to Thetis.</p>
        <p>She flew back down to earth. "Suit up," she told Achilles. "It's time."</p>
