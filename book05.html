        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 5</p>

        <h2>Diomedes Goes Beast Mode</h2>
        <p>Meet Diomedes. He’s a Greek king, and today is his day. He’s in the zone. He’s possessed by the spirit of war.</p>
        <p>Athena is literally standing behind his chariot, hyping him up. She took the "fog" off his eyes so he can spot the gods on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Diomedes starts wrecking shop. He’s killing Trojan soldiers left and right. It looks like a horror movie. Bodies dropping everywhere.</p>

        <h2>Aeneas vs. Diomedes</h2>
        <p>Pandarus—that guy who shot the arrow in the last book—steps up. He says to Aeneas, "Yo, let's get Diomedes."</p>
        <p>Pandarus throws a spear. Hits Diomedes' shoulder. But Diomedes is built different. He barely flinches.</p>
        <p>Diomedes throws his spear back. *Kaboom.* It goes right through Pandarus' face. Game over for him.</p>
        <p>Now it's Diomedes vs. Aeneas. Aeneas grabs a rock—he’s about to crush Diomedes. But Aeneas is a demigod son of Aphrodite, so he has backup.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Aphrodite Gets Cut</h2>
        <p>Aphrodite sees her son Aeneas is in trouble. She throws a cloud over him to hide him and grabs him to pull him out.</p>
        <p>Diomedes sees the goddess. He doesn't care. "Get off the field, goddess!" he yells.</p>
        <p>He lunges with his spear and cuts her wrist.</p>
        <p>She screams. *Ichor*—that’s god blood—spills out. It looks gold. It hurts like crazy because gods are usually immortal.</p>
        <p>Aphrodite drops Aeneas and runs away crying to Olympus. "Dad, did you see that? Diomedes just tried to scrap me!"</p>

        <h2>Apollo Intervenes</h2>
        <p>Apollo, Aeneas' other dad (long story), catches his son before he hits the ground.</p>
        <p>He creates a fake body of Aeneas so the Greeks can fight over that while he teleports the real Aeneas back to his shrine to heal.</p>
        <p>Diomedes, still hyped on rage, screams at Apollo. "I’m coming for you too!"</p>
        <p>Apollo looks at him. "Nah, son. Don't be dumb. I'm an eternal god. Don't step to me."</p>
        <p>Diomedes backs down. He knows his limits.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>The Rivalry</h2>
        <p>Ares, the God of War, is on the Trojan side. He sees how hard Diomedes is killing his team. He decides to get involved disguised as a mortal.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Athena finds Diomedes again. "I see you winning," she says. "I’m giving you a permanent buff. If Ares comes near, hit him. He’s a punk."</p>

        <h2>Diomedes vs. Ares</h2>
        <p>Ares and Diomedes meet. Ares throws a spear, Athena swats it away. Then Diomedes throws his spear. Athena guides it.</p>
        <p>*THUNK.*</p>
        <p>The spear hits Ares right in the gut. It goes deep. Ares lets out a scream that sounds like 10,000 soldiers yelling at once.</p>
        <p>Ares drops his spear. He looks like he got jumped in an alley. He blasts off back to Olympus, terrified.</p>

        <h2>The Roast Session on Olympus</h2>
        <p>Ares stumbles in, bleeding god-blood. He sits next to Zeus and cries.</p>
        <p>"Dad, look at this wound! Athena set me up!"</p>
        <p>Zeus gives him the dirtiest look. "You're pathetic," Zeus says. "You love fighting, but you can't handle getting hit. You're the most annoying god I have."</p>
        <p>Zeus tells the healers to patch Ares up. Hera and Athena are lowkey laughing.</p>

        <h2>The End of the Day</h2>
        <p>Back on Earth, Diomedes is a legend. The Trojans are terrified of him. They think he’s invincible.</p>
        <p>The Trojans retreat back to their city walls. The Greeks are winning big time.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center; color:#666; margin-top:40px;">End of Book 5</p>
