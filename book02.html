Since the *Iliad* is very long, I have generated the code for **Book 2** below. You can save this as `illiad-book2.html` to read the next part of the story.

If you want the rest (Book 3, 4, etc.), just let me know and I can generate them one by one.

        <h1>The Iliad</h1>
        <p class="intro">Urban Slang Edition • Book 2</p>

        <h2>The Fake News</h2>
        <p>That night, Zeus sent a dream to Agamemnon. It looked like Nestor, that old wise guy. The dream lied to him.</p>
        <p>"Yo, Agamemnon," the dream said. "You sleeping on the job? The gods are on your side now. You need to attack Troy today. You got this."</p>
        <p>Agamemnon woke up hype. He really thought he was gonna sack the city that day. He put on his gear and called the homies.</p>

        <h2>The Gaslight</h2>
        <p>Agamemmon stood up to speak. But he had a trick in mind. He wanted to test his soldiers.</p>
        <p>"Listen up," he lied. "Zeus is being shady. He told me we can't win. It's been nine years. We're stuck here. I'm tired. Let's pack up the boats and go home."</p>
        <p>He didn't really want to leave. He just wanted the boys to scream "No!" and get hyped to fight.</p>

        <h2>The Riot</h2>
        <p>But the plan backfired. As soon as he said "Go home," the army went crazy.</p>
        <p>They didn't scream "No!" They screamed "Bet!"</p>
        <p>Everyone ran to the ships. They were dragging them to the water. Dust was flying everywhere. It was chaos. They were deserting him.</p>

        <h2>Odysseus Steps In</h2>
        <p>Athena saw the mess. She came down and found Odysseus. "What are you doing?" she asked. "Are you gonna let them leave? Stop them!"</p>
        <p>Odysseus grabbed Agamemnon. "What is wrong with you?" he said. "Why you testing them? Now look at this mess."</p>
        <p>Odysseus ran to the ships. He wasn't asking nicely. He grabbed the scepter. If he saw a king, he said, "Chill, bro. You know better than Agamemnon."</p>
        <p>If he saw a regular soldier, he smacked him with the stick. "Get back in line, peasant!"</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h2>Thersites Gets Checked</h2>
        <p>Then there was Thersites. This guy was the ugliest troll in the army. Bow-legged, messed up hair, always running his mouth.</p>
        <p>He stood up and started roasting Agamemnon in front of everyone. "Look at this greedy clown," he yelled. "Always wanting the best loot. I'm going home!"</p>
        <p>The army started laughing. But Odysseus wasn't having it.</p>
        <p>He walked up to Thersites and backhanded him hard. Thersites started crying. A big welt popped up on his back.</p>
        <p>"Sit down and shut up," Odysseus said. "You think you can roast the king? You ain't nobody."</p>
        <p>The soldiers laughed at Thersites instead. Odysseus got the crowd back under control.</p>

        <h2>The Lineup (The Catalog)</h2>
        <p>Finally, the army calmed down. They got organized. Time for roll call. This list is long, so pay attention.</p>
        
        <h3>The Greeks (The Argives)</h3>
        <p>Agamemnon brought the most ships (100). He's the boss.</p>
        <p>Ajax the Greater brought 12 ships. That guy is a tank.</p>
        <p>Idomeneus came from Crete with 80 ships.</p>
        <p>Odysseus came from Ithaca with Cephallenians. 12 ships. They are smart fighters.</p>
        <p>Achilles and the Myrmidons? Yeah, they chilling by the ships. Not joining the huddle.</p>
        <p>There were troops from Athens, Sparta, Pylos, Arcadia... seriously, everyone was there. Thousands of soldiers. It looked like a sea of bronze and spears.</p>

        <div class="verse-break">•</div>

        <h3>The Trojans</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, across the field, the Trojans were gearing up too. They were stationed in front of the city walls.</p>
        <p>Hector was the main man. Everyone looked up to him.</p>
        <p>Aeneas was there too, with his crew.</p>
        <p>Priam’s sons: Helenus, Deiphobus, Paris (that pretty boy who started this mess).</p>
        <p>Sarpedon showed up with the Lycians. He was ready to throw hands.</p>
        <p>And the allies? Glaucus, Asteropaeus... a whole squad of tough guys from foreign lands.</p>

        <h2>The Showdown</h2>
        <p>The two armies stood on the plain. It was tense. Like two gangs facing off in the street.</p>
        <p>Alexander (Paris) stepped out from the Trojan line. He had leopard skin on his shoulders and a bow. He looked flashy.</p>
        <p>He wanted to go mano-a-mano with the Greeks. He wanted to fight Menelaus.</p>
        <p>Menelaus saw him. "There he is," he said. "The guy who played me."</p>
        <p>The Greeks cheered. The Trojans shivered. The battle was about to pop off.</p>
